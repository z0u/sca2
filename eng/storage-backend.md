# The storage backend: Hugging Face buckets

*Part of the [engineering notes](./README.md).*

A bucket is a Xet-backed repo type, **mutable, with no git history**: you overwrite in
place, and there are no commits to conflict. That last property is load-bearing —
independent workers can write results concurrently without a coordination step, where a
git-backed dataset repo would 412 on the shared parent. Immutability of `cas/<sha>` is
therefore *our* discipline (write-once-by-hash), not the backend's guarantee.

**The latency floor shapes the whole API.** Every bucket read or write pays a fixed
~2–3s round trip before any bytes move (the Xet handshake + commit), independent of
size; throughput above the floor is ~10–35 MB/s. Consequences:

- **Batch or parallelize writes.** Eight serial commits took ~15s; one batched commit,
  or eight *concurrent* commits, ~2–2.6s. The floor is overlappable latency, not a
  server-side lock — so workers write independently and we batch when files are already
  in hand.
- **Batch reads the same way.** The floor is per *call*, not per byte: eight sequential
  cold ref-reads measured ~12s and eight sequential blob gets ~11s, where one batched
  paths-info + one `download_bucket_files` for the same set is ~3s and ~2s. So
  `get_refs`/`get_many` resolve a set in one request, a tree `get` prefetches all its
  children in one pull, and report/eval loops should reach for the batch verbs rather
  than looping `get_ref`/`get`. (Warm-cache re-reads are local and effectively free —
  the cache was never the bottleneck, the per-call floor was.)
- **Bucket transfers already ride the Xet layers.** Since `huggingface_hub` ≥ 1.19,
  `download_bucket_files`/`batch_bucket_files` go through the shared `hf_xet` session,
  so chunk-level dedup and the `HF_HOME/xet` chunk cache apply to bucket blobs too (on
  Modal that cache sits on the shared `mini-hf-cache` Volume — see
  [decisions](./decisions.md)). There's no separate faster path to route reads through;
  what costs is the per-call metadata round trips, hence the batching above.
- **Keep checkpoints on the volume, not the CAS** (see
  [Non-goals](./decisions.md)) — content-addressing mutable, superseded state pays the
  floor repeatedly for nothing.

The bucket holds the durable tier — `cas/<sha>` + `refs/` — and can be **private**: the
public, versioned *publish* tier (`published/`, `exports/`) splits off onto a dataset repo
when `publish-repo` is set, so persisting an artifact never makes its bytes world-readable.
See [Publishing](./publishing.md) for that split (#38).
