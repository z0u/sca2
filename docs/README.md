# docs/

This directory contains executable experiment reports (literate scripts) and source files for the project site. The site is built into `_site/` — by `./go preview` locally, or `./go site` in CI.

## File types

### Literate scripts

Reports (`.py`) are the primary content, and the only thing in Git; the exported HTML is never committed. A literate script is a plain Python file where a top-level string literal is prose (an f-string where it quotes a value, so ruff, ty, and vulture see the names it reads) and the code between prose strings is a cell, with `# title:` (and `# code: show`, for a page about the code; a report hides its cells) as comment lines at the top; ruff, ty, and the IDE see every cell. A `# %%` line splits a cell where prose would not fit. Only a cell's last expression is displayed (a string as Markdown, a matplotlib figure saved and shown), and the runner refuses a displayable value anywhere else in a cell rather than dropping it. Every top-level string is prose, so a variable docstring hung under a constant would weave as a paragraph; write it as a comment (`./go lint` flags it). `./go render docs/tour.py -o tour.md` weaves it to the files you name (`.md`, `.html`, or `.pdf`, repeating `-o` for several); `./go serve` re-weaves on save with live reload. See `mini.lit` and `todo/eng/literate-reports.md` for the design.

`./go publish` exports each report to a self-contained bundle (`index.html` plus a name-keyed `_assets/`), and mirrors it to the HF bucket under `exports/<key>/`. The export also writes a small copy of every figure under `_assets/thumbs/` and declares them in the HTML, so an index page's figure strips (a `mini:figures` marker in a Markdown file; see [`build_site.py`](../scripts/build_site.py)) cost a few KB per figure rather than the full-size PNG; a strip opens with a chip linking the report's PDF. The site build then defers every figure until it scrolls into view, and makes it click-to-enlarge in an overlay — both from the HTML alone, so they apply to reports published before either existed. The key is the report's docs-relative path without the suffix, so `docs/overview.py` becomes `overview` and `docs/foo/bar.py` becomes `foo/bar`. A report named `report.py` is the exception: it takes its directory as the key, so `docs/foo/report.py` becomes `foo`, and a one-report experiment publishes at `foo/` rather than the redundant `foo/report/`.

Publishing also records the commit sha that the bundle landed as into [`publish.lock`](./publish.lock). Commit that file. Under a storage profile (`MINI_PROFILE=dev`; the `mi-ni` skill's storage reference) the pins go to a gitignored `.mini/publish.<profile>.lock` instead, so an engineering publish never moves the production record. The site serves each report at its pinned revision, so a publish from a branch deploys nothing until the pin reaches main; the PR preview serves the branch's pins meanwhile.

Forgetting to publish is caught rather than done for you, in two places. The push hook ([`pre-push-check.sh`](../.claude/hooks/pre-push-check.sh)) blocks a push that changed a report without moving its pin, and CI's `Reports published` step repeats the check on the PR. Both run [`scripts/unpublished_reports.py`](../scripts/unpublished_reports.py) — a git diff against the base branch, compared with `publish.lock` — so neither needs the store, a render, or a write token. The publish itself stays with you, in the session that already has a warm store.

Three ways past it, in rising order of permanence: `git push --no-verify` gets a push out now (CI still flags it); the `skip-publish-check` label settles it for one PR; and `# mini:manual-publish` in a report (see `mini.reports`) opts that report out for good, for one you'd rather publish on your own schedule.

`./go site` (CI) then assembles `_site/` from the pinned bundles, serving each report at `_site/<key>/index.html`, with the URL `<key>/`. `./go preview` assembles the same site locally: it exports stale reports to `.mini/exports/` and copies their assets beside the HTML, so it works offline.

### Markdown files

Markdown (`.md`) is converted to HTML and written to `_site/` at the same relative path. Links to a report's `.py` are rewritten to its rendered `<key>/` page. This `README.md` is excluded from the build.

### Other assets

Images, SVGs, and the like are copied as-is into `_site/`.

### Shared report styles

[`report.css`](./report.css) is one stylesheet for cross-report polish: `.sw` color swatches via [`colors.swatch`](../src/sca/data/colors.py), `.report-table` alignment and its scroll box, and quiet `<details>`. The page frame — the reading measure, booktabs table rules, and the full-page width every figure and table gets — is [`mini.lit`'s own sheet](../src/mini/lit/lit.css); this one layers on top. Its `@media print` block sizes the page for e-ink (a reMarkable 2). The site build prints each report through it (`mini.report_print`), on a page grown until every section fits on one and then clipped to its content, so every report page has a `report.pdf` beside it, linked from the nav chip; the `report-render` skill prints the same way for checking a print-style edit. The build keeps a memo of what it printed from (`_site/pdfs.json`, and on the deployed site the previous deploy's copy), so a report is printed again only when its page, this stylesheet, or the print tooling changed, and a print-style edit reaches every report's PDF on the next build. A PR preview prints from a page whose links lead to production (a PDF is read away from the site, so it links to the durable URL), which is what lets it borrow production's PDF for every report the PR left alone and print only the ones it changed; the one visible consequence is that a preview PDF's link to a report new in that PR has nowhere to go until the PR merges. A print for review (`./go render <report> -o <name>.pdf`, made from the export the same way) also names the commit it was printed from on its first page, and `--since <commit>` bars its margin beside every line changed since that commit ([`mini.review_marks`](../src/mini/review_marks.py), with the baseline exported from a checkout of the commit by [`review_base.py`](../scripts/review_base.py)), for a reviewer who reads it in rounds.

`mini.lit` inlines it into every page it renders (`mini.reports.report_styles`), so it shows live under `./go serve` and bakes into the export. The build re-inlines it from source as well (`mini.reports.set_report_styles`), so editing `report.css` restyles every published report without re-exporting any report. Keep it small and selector-scoped. `mini.lit`'s own sheets (`base.css`, shared with the site's Markdown pages, and `lit.css`, whose header maps where all the CSS lives) have no such seam — they are baked at export time only, so a change there reaches a report on its next export (`./go publish` always re-exports; `./go preview` needs `--force`).

## Structure

```

├── README.md                This file (excluded from build)
├── report.css               Shared report stylesheet (inlined by mini.lit at render + re-inlined at build;
│                            its @media print block shapes each report's report.pdf)
├── publish.lock             Export key → pinned publish-tier revision (written by ./go publish)
├── index.md                 Built as _site/index.html
├── overview.py              Literate script → exported bundle, served at _site/overview/
└── ex-9.9/                  An experiment, split into definition + report
    ├── experiment.py        Importable main(ctx) DAG — not a report, so the build ignores it
    └── report.py            Literate script → served at _site/ex-9.9/
```

Exported bundles live (gitignored) under `.mini/exports/<key>/` locally; their durable home is the bucket. Nothing under `docs/` holds generated HTML.

`./go render <report> -o <file>` is the light form, for reading rather than serving: the weave alone (no provenance or thumbnails), written to each `-o` file in the format its extension names (`.md`, `.html`, or `.pdf`). The Markdown is the same document as the page, with figures as `<figure>` links to the files in `_assets/` beside it. See the `report-render` skill.

Heavier or multi-step experiments live in a subdirectory as an importable `experiment.py` (the definition, driven by the `mini` CLI) plus a `report.py` literate script, which reads durable results and publishes. A plain `.py` that isn't a literate script (no `# title:` header) is ignored by the build, so the definition module never lands on the site. See the `mi-ni` skill for authoring, running, and monitoring.
