"""Serve a locally-assembled ``_site/`` with GitHub Pages semantics.

``npx serve`` (serve-handler) decides file-vs-directory from ``path.extname()``, a
string check — so it mistakes our dotted report dirs (``m1/ex-2.9.1``) for files,
skips its ``index.html`` lookup, and renders a directory listing. Working around it
with redirects means emitting 301s, which browsers cache permanently and replay as
loops long after the config is fixed.

So we stat the filesystem instead, matching GitHub Pages: a directory with no
``index.html`` is a 404; one that has it redirects to the trailing-slash form (so the
page's relative ``_assets/`` resolve against ``…/ex-2.1.1/``, not its parent) and then
serves the index. The redirect is a 302, not GitHub's 301 — a preview server churns,
and a cached permanent redirect is the exact footgun that made us drop ``npx serve``.
