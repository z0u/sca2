"""Report relative Markdown links and `#anchor` fragments that no longer resolve.

The skills and `eng/` docs navigate by relative link, and several carry a fragment into a named section. Nothing reads these paths but agents, so both failure modes are quiet: a moved file gives a dead link nobody clicks, and a renamed heading is worse — the link still opens the file, just at the top, so a session following it lands somewhere plausible and reads the wrong section. This makes both loud at the point the rename happens.

Only *relative* targets are checked. An `http(s)://` or `mailto:` link needs the network to verify and goes stale for reasons outside this repo, which is a different job with a different failure rate.

Two strips before any matching, both load-bearing. Fenced code blocks hold illustrative fragments that contain bracket-paren pairs — `todo/eng/ty-loses-pep695-alias.md`'s repro has `(x: Sequence[T])`, which reads as a link target otherwise. Inline code spans hold links quoted *as examples*: `.agents/skills/mi-ni/references/reports.md` deliberately shows ``[experiment](./experiment.py)`` as the shape a report author writes, and without the strip it is reported against whichever directory the doc happens to sit in.

Anchors are matched against GitHub's slugs, since that is where these docs are read: lowercase, drop anything that isn't a letter, digit, space, hyphen or underscore, then spaces to hyphens, with `-1`/`-2` suffixes for repeats. So "Provenance & cost" is `#provenance--cost` — the removed `&` leaves the two spaces that become two hyphens. Explicit `id=`/`name=` attributes on inline HTML count as anchors too, which is how a hand-written target survives a heading rewrite.

The file set comes from `git ls-files`, including untracked-but-not-ignored files — a doc written this session is the likeliest place for a link to be wrong, so listing only what git already knows about would hand it a clean bill of health. `.gitignore` does the excluding, so `.venv/`, `_site/`, `.mini/` and `.claude/worktrees/` drop out without a rule of their own, and `.claude/skills` is a tracked *symlink* to `.agents/skills`, so git lists the real files once and the walk can't double-report through it.
