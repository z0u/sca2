"""Build the static site from the project's report notebooks.

The HTML lives nowhere in Git: each report is exported (``./go publish``) to a self-contained bundle — ``index.html`` + named-keyed ``_assets/`` — and mirrored to the bucket under ``exports/<key>/``. The assembly mode is an explicit choice, never inferred from credentials:

``--externalize`` (CI, ``./go site``) The deterministic, read-only half of publishing: read each *synced* bundle's HTML, resolve author links against the repo, insert one ``<base>`` pointing at the bucket, and write only ``_site/<key>/index.html`` (asset bytes stay on the CDN). Requires a configured store; fails loudly without one.

``--localize`` (local preview, ``./go preview``) Read the bundles from ``.mini/exports/`` and copy their ``_assets/`` beside the HTML, so the site works offline. Never touches the network.
