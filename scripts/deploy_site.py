"""Build the whole site and deploy it as one commit.

The site is a function of two things: `main`, which production is built from, and the set of open PRs, each of which gets a preview under `pr-preview/pr-<n>/`. So every run builds all of it from scratch and force-pushes the result to `gh-pages` as a single parentless commit. Nothing on the branch carries over from one run to the next, and nothing has to be torn down: a closed PR is absent from the next build, whatever event (or none) its close produced.

**Why reconcile rather than react.** The arrangement this replaced had three writers of `gh-pages` — a production deploy on push to `main`, a preview deploy per PR event, and a teardown on close — each writing one slice of the branch and leaving the rest alone. Every guard it grew was about the other writers: a lease on the history prune, `force: false` on the deploy, `clean-exclude` on the umbrella directory, and finally a sweep for the previews whose teardown had been overwritten by an in-flight build or never scheduled at all (seven of them by 2026-08-31, two thirds of what the site served). A run that rebuilds everything from current state has no other writers to guard against, and it makes the workflow's single concurrency group safe: a pending run displaced by a newer arrival loses nothing, because the newer run reads the same state, later. `eng/publishing.md` has the longer form.

**What the previous deploy is for.** Each build prints its reports' PDFs (`build_site.PdfMemo`), and the one thing a from-scratch rebuild would waste is those prints: a few seconds each, for every report of every preview, when almost none of them changed. So the run fetches what `gh-pages` serves now and hands each build the matching part of it (the root to production, `pr-preview/pr-<n>/` to that PR, and the root again for a PR to borrow from) as a memo: a manifest beside the PDFs says what each was printed from, and a report whose page and tooling are unchanged keeps its file, or takes production's. The branch stays one commit deep and is still rewritten whole; it is read before it is replaced.

**What it costs** is rebuilding every preview on every event, at about 30 s each. This repository has a handful of PRs open at a time, so a run is a minute or two. A preview that fails to build is reported (a warning, and a failed status on the PR head) and skipped, so a broken branch never holds back production.

**The open-PR list is read before anything is built**, so an API failure stops the run rather than deploying a site with no previews. Only same-repo PRs get one: a fork's branch would run with the repository's secrets in scope, which is the boundary the preview workflow has always kept. Each PR's file list is read then too, for the reports its statuses link: the pins it adds or moves in `docs/publish.lock`.

**Why statuses rather than a comment.** The links reach the PR as commit statuses on its head: one for the preview, one per report the PR publishes, each a "Details" link in the PR's checks box. Until 2026-10-01 they were one comment per PR, rewritten on every push because it named the commit it was built from. An agent subscribed to the PR is woken by every comment and every edit, and a preview link asks nothing of it; commit statuses don't wake it. A status also belongs to the commit it describes, so a new push clears the old links on its own.
