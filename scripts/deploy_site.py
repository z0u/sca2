"""Build the whole site and deploy it as one commit.

The site is a function of two things: `main`, which production is built from, and the set of open PRs, each of which gets a preview under `pr-preview/pr-<n>/`. So every run builds all of it from scratch and force-pushes the result to `gh-pages` as a single parentless commit. Nothing on the branch carries over from one run to the next, and nothing has to be torn down: a closed PR is absent from the next build, whatever event (or none) its close produced.

**Why reconcile rather than react.** The arrangement this replaced had three writers of `gh-pages` — a production deploy on push to `main`, a preview deploy per PR event, and a teardown on close — each writing one slice of the branch and leaving the rest alone. Every guard it grew was about the other writers: a lease on the history prune, `force: false` on the deploy, `clean-exclude` on the umbrella directory, and finally a sweep for the previews whose teardown had been overwritten by an in-flight build or never scheduled at all (seven of them by 2026-08-31, two thirds of what the site served). A run that rebuilds everything from current state has no other writers to guard against, and it makes the workflow's single concurrency group safe: a pending run displaced by a newer arrival loses nothing, because the newer run reads the same state, later. `eng/publishing.md` has the longer form.

**What it costs** is rebuilding every preview on every event, at about 30 s each. This repository has a handful of PRs open at a time, so a run is a minute or two. A preview that fails to build is reported (a warning, and a note on the PR) and skipped, so a broken branch never holds back production.

**The open-PR list is read before anything is built**, so an API failure stops the run rather than deploying a site with no previews. Only same-repo PRs get one: a fork's branch would run with the repository's secrets in scope, which is the boundary the preview workflow has always kept.
