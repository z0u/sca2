"""Report notebooks this branch changed without republishing — the forgotten-publish check.

``./go publish`` is the step of the loop that has to be remembered, and forgetting it fails quietly: the notebook merges, the site keeps serving the previous export's figures, and nothing says so. This is the tripwire. It compares what the branch *changed* against what it *repinned* in ``docs/publish.lock``, and names the gap. "Changed" covers a report's own directory, not just its notebook — see :func:`changed_reports`.

Both halves are cheap and local — a git diff and a JSON file — so the check needs no store access, no render, and no write credentials. That's the point: the publish itself stays where the data is (a session with a warm store), and CI only has to notice when it didn't happen.

The comparison is also self-correcting when ``origin/main`` is behind, which it often is in a fresh container: a stale base makes *more* reports look changed, but their pins moved in that same range, so they don't register as unpublished.

    A report is dated by its inputs as much as by its own source: re-running an experiment writes new results and edits ``docs/<key>/experiment.py``, leaving ``report.py`` untouched, and the bundle then serves the previous run's figures. So the notebook's own directory counts as part of it (:func:`~mini.reports.input_dir`) — every changed file under it dates the report, except a *sibling report*, which is a second document rather than an input to the first.

    The diff is three-dot (``base...HEAD``), i.e. against the merge base, so commits that landed on the base branch meanwhile aren't mistaken for ours. Deletions need no filtering: the candidates come from the reports that exist *now*, so a deleted report simply isn't among them (it has no bundle to publish, and the next publish prunes its pin — ``export_reports.update_pins``), while a deleted input still dates the report it belonged to.

    Scoped to ``docs/`` by the same reasoning as :func:`~mini.reports.report_notebooks`: a report is a notebook *there*. Without the pathspec, anything in the repo carrying the text ``marimo.App(`` reads as a report — this module's own tests, for instance.
