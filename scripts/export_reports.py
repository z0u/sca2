"""Export reports to self-contained bundles, optionally syncing to the bucket.

Each report (a literate script under ``docs/``; :func:`~mini.reports.is_report`) exports to its own bundle at ``.mini/exports/<key>/`` — ``index.html`` plus the name-keyed ``_assets/`` its publisher wrote (``mini.lit.render`` installs a publisher aimed at the output's ``_assets/``). After the weave, provenance, thumbnails and the sync follow; the PDF is the site build's. With ``--publish`` each bundle is then mirrored to the configured HF bucket at ``exports/<key>/``: the authenticated half of publishing (it needs the data the report reads + a write token). ``scripts/build_site.py`` assembles the site from these bundles — the synced ones in CI (read-only), the local ones offline.
