"""Export report notebooks to self-contained bundles, optionally syncing to the bucket.

Each report (a ``docs/**/*.py`` declaring ``marimo.App(``) exports to its own bundle at
``.mini/exports/<key>/`` — ``index.html`` plus the named-keyed ``_assets/`` its setup
cell's :func:`~mini.reports.report_bundle` publisher wrote. With ``--publish`` each
bundle is then mirrored to the configured HF bucket at ``exports/<key>/``: the
authenticated half of publishing (it needs the data the report reads + a write token).
``scripts/build_site.py`` assembles the site from these bundles — the synced ones in CI
(read-only), the local ones offline.
