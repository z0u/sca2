"""End-to-end coverage for the two experiment patterns, against the *shipped* demos.

The rest of the suite drives inline ``Experiment(...)`` objects; here we exercise
the real files under ``docs/`` the way a user (or the CLI) does, so a demo can't
bit-rot — a broken import, a drifted ``main(ctx)`` signature, or a ``load_experiment``
contract change fails CI instead of silently rotting the onboarding examples.

- **Memoized / detached pattern:** ``load_experiment(<file>)`` then drive the real
  ``main(ctx)`` DAG to completion on a ``LocalApparatus`` (detached subprocess
  workers + the durable memo store) — the same path ``mini run`` takes.
- **Interactive pattern:** drive an ``Apparatus`` directly (as a notebook does),
  fanning a sweep out with ``.map`` and reducing — no memo store, no CLI.

The light demos (``pipeline``, the ``acts``/``probe`` pair) run to completion; the
GPU/Modal-heavy ``ngpt-scaling`` is only *loaded* (import + construct), which still
catches rot cheaply.
