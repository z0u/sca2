# Backlogs

Three backlogs, one file per item: [`eng/`](./eng/) for infrastructure and tooling, [`science/`](./science/) for experiment questions and findings, [`style/`](./style/) for text and visual improvements. Each set has its own README saying what belongs in it.

One file per item keeps two branches from colliding, since adding items adds files rather than editing the same lines. It also gives every item a stable name that a commit, a PR, or an `eng/` doc can point at.

## Reading

`./go todo` prints the index, generated on demand rather than committed, so there is no second copy to fall out of step with the files.

```bash
./go todo                      # every live item, all three sets
./go todo science              # one set (eng | science | style)
./go todo --tag cli --tag storage   # conjunctive: items carrying both
./go todo --status finding      # settled results worth keeping
./go todo --bundle cli-devx    # one session's worth
./go todo --priority           # the shortlist: what to pick up next
./go todo --grep anneal        # title or body matches a regex; shows a window around each hit
./go todo --grep anneal --grep margin --window 30   # conjunctive; N characters of context each side
./go todo --priority --full    # print whole bodies, wrapped to the terminal
./go todo --grep anneal --tags # count the tags across the selection, most-used first
./go todo --check              # validate frontmatter, priority budget, and tag spelling
./go todo --json               # for scripts; with --grep, each row carries its match windows
```

The default view shows `open` and `partial` only. Settled work and findings are still there and `--status` reaches them. Shortlisted items take a `!` beside their status mark and sort to the head of their group, so a plain `./go todo` shows the ranking without being asked.

`--tags` is how to learn the vocabulary: it counts the tags over whatever the other filters kept, so `--tag anchoring --tags` is one step of a drill-down. Tags are case-sensitive, and `--check` refuses two spellings of one tag; deliverable and milestone tags are capitalised (`D2.1`, `M3`), the rest lower-case.

`--grep` goes through the same filters as the listing, so it searches live work by default and `--status done --grep` reaches settled items, which a plain `rg` over the directory can't do. Paragraphs are one line each in the files, which is why hits are shown as windows and `--full` wraps.

## Writing

Front matter, a `# Title`, then prose. `status` is the only required key.

```markdown
---
status: open           # open | partial | done | finding
tags: [cli, storage]   # optional
opened: 2026-08-13     # optional; many inherited items have none
closed: 2026-08-14     # optional, and only on a done item
bundle: cli-devx       # optional; groups items one dev session should take together
priority: high         # optional; the shortlist, capped at six live items
---
# A title, as the first heading

The body, as ordinary prose. The file is a document, so there is room to say why. One line per paragraph, soft-wrapped.
```

`finding` is for established knowledge rather than work: a result worth keeping.

`priority: high` is the only level, and absence is the default. At most six live items may have it: priority schemes decay when promotion is free. A seventh item requires demoting something else. Settled items don't count against the cap.

Settled items stay where they are: the default view already hides them, and leaving them put keeps their inbound links and file history intact.

## PM notes

If you have context to pass on that isn't a change to the item (evidence checked, a reason the item looks closeable, a blocker) — put that in a `## Notes` section at the foot of the item body, dated and signed:

```markdown
## Notes

**2026-08-14, housekeeping** — ex-2.1.6 finished on 08-11 and the margins are in the store, so this looks closeable. I couldn't confirm the anti-subspace claim from the report alone.
```

Try not to let this grow without bound: edit your own notes, and tidy up others.
