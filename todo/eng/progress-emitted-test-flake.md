# `test_progress_emitted_during_training` flaked once under load

**Fixed by #78**, which turned out to already cover this: the training loop's placeholder `total=0` message races the real `emit_progress` total, and the old set-equality assertion held the placeholder to the same standard as a real total. #78 filters it out (`{m.total for m in messages if m.total} == {max(steps)}`) and adds a check on the final message's step/total instead. This item was migrated from a second, differently-worded note describing the same assertion and the same root cause — it just never got removed when #78 landed. Original note follows. `tests/sca/test_training.py::test_progress_emitted_during_training` failed once under `-n auto` on a loaded container (#73), at `{m.total for m in messages} == {max(steps)}`, and passed on the next three full-suite runs and on a serial re-run. Not reproduced since, so the cause is unconfirmed. `total` is constant across `emit_progress` calls and `BackgroundEmitter.close` flushes synchronously, so the likely shape is a second message reaching the queue from the metrics path with a different `total` — i.e. the assertion is stricter about queue contents than the contract really is. Worth reproducing under artificial load before changing anything. Noted while upgrading dependencies; nothing in that upgrade touches the debouncer, but it has not been ruled out either.
