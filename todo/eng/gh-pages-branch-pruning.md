# `gh-pages` branch pruning

This is where we publish reports to; see `.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml`. Currently the branch history is linear, and contains a commit for every preview build and every build on `main`. We should compact it, probably on every `main` build. How many commits to keep? Unsure, maybe ~1 week, maybe only those from `main` and currently-open branches. Maybe the Action that we use supports this out of the box.

Measured 2026-08-10, so the growth rate is on record rather than guessed at: 239 commits since the branch opened on 2026-07-14 (~8/day), 7.5 MiB of history against `main`'s 2.2 MiB, and a 17.9 MiB working tree across 177 files. Nothing to act on yet at that size — the note is when, not whether.

The action does have it out of the box: `single-commit: true` on `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`, which the docs are blunt about — "using this option will also cause any existing history to be wiped from the deployment branch". Two interactions to settle before reaching for it, and the docs cover neither. It has to force-push, where the production deploy runs `force: false` precisely so it rebases onto a concurrent preview deploy rather than dropping it; and the PR previews live in the same tree under `clean-exclude: pr-preview/`, so their *files* should survive into the single commit while a preview deploy racing the force push would not. That race is rare and self-healing (the next preview deploy restores it), but it is the thing to check rather than assume. A `main`-only prune that keeps a window of commits avoids both by never rewriting what a preview is standing on.

If it's easy to do, see if there's a way to publish tags or releases too. E.g. d2.1 marks the nominal end of that deliverable, and it's marked as an indelible release on GH. It would be nice if the tag became a permalink for the site at that point in time. We don't have many tags, so it shouldn't grow too fast. If it adds significant complexity to this pruning piece, it could be split into a new todo.

## Notes

**2026-08-30, closing** — Done as the windowed `main`-only prune, not `single-commit`: `scripts/prune_gh_pages.py`, run as the last step of `publish-docs.yml`. It keeps the newest 3 commits and only acts once the branch passes 10; both numbers are on the workflow's command line, so the step says what it does without opening the script. The force-push carries `--force-with-lease` against the tip it fetched, so a preview deploy landing mid-prune keeps the branch and the prune waits for the next build — the race the item flagged, handled by yielding rather than by timing.

Measured again before building: 340 commits, of which 296 were preview churn (`Deploy preview for PR N` / `Remove preview for PR N`) against ~43 production deploys — so the growth is dominated by previews, and a window measured in commits rather than days tracks it better than the earlier ~8/day estimate suggested.

The window was first set at 40/120, sized against clone bytes, and cut to 3/10 once the real complaint turned out to be legibility: 40 deploy commits still swamp the opening screen of `tig --all`. That reopened the `single-commit` question, and the history settled it — a merge fires the preview teardown and the production deploy at the same moment, and they land 2 to 6 seconds apart, so an unguarded force-push on every deploy is a coin flip against the teardown on every merge. Losing it resurrects that PR's preview permanently, since the teardown workflow has already run. The lease is what makes a small window safe, so the frequency of pruning is only a question of noise. Rationale in the script's docstring and `eng/publishing.md`.

**2026-08-31, first live run** — It shipped inert, and the fix is in a follow-up. The prune step read the 344-commit branch as **1 commit** and declined. The deploy step that runs immediately before it fetches `gh-pages` at `--depth=1` into the same repository, so our plain fetch found nothing to pull and `rev-list` stopped at the shallow boundary. `fetch_tip` now `--unshallow`s when the repo is shallow, and raises if it somehow still is afterwards — because a short count fails as "nothing to do", which looks exactly like the healthy no-op.

Worth keeping as a testing lesson rather than just a bug. The original fixture cloned `main` shallow, which felt like it covered the runner, but let the pruner meet `gh-pages` fresh — so it tested a sequence CI never runs. The fixture now performs the deploy action's own `--depth=1` fetch first, and reverting the fix fails five tests with the same line CI printed.

The tag-permalink rider is split out as [`site-permalinks-for-tags`](./site-permalinks-for-tags.md). It needs its own deploy path, and pruning doesn't get in its way: a prune copies the tip's tree verbatim, so a `v/<tag>/` subtree would survive one the same way the preview trees do.
