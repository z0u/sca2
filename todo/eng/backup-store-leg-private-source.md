# The backup's store leg can't copy from a private source bucket

The first live run of the backup job failed its store leg with a bare `422 Unprocessable Entity` from `POST /api/buckets/z0u-bot/sca2-backup-store/batch`, and copied none of the 1954 files. The publish and code legs were unaffected.

The cause is a mismatch between the credential split and the shape of the server-side copy. The copy is one request: it goes to the *destination* bucket's endpoint carrying the destination's token, and names the source bucket in each `copyFile` operation. The Hub authorises it against that one token — ["You need read access to the source repository or bucket and write access to the destination bucket"](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/storage-buckets#copying-files-between-repos-and-buckets). But the backup design issues no token holding both: `SOURCE_HF_TOKEN` reads the source, and `HF_BUCKET_TOKEN` is minted from the trusted publisher scoped to `buckets/<ns>/<project>-backup-store`. A fine-grained token carries implicit read on public repos only, so a private source is invisible to it and the Hub answers `Source repository not found: buckets/<ns>/<project>-store` — the same wording it uses for a bucket that does not exist.

Probed against the live API with a hash that cannot resolve, so nothing was written: a readable source gives `file not found in source repo`, an unreadable private one gives `Source repository not found`, both under 422. A positive control (a real copy within `z0u/sca2-store`, since that token can read and write it) succeeded, so the mechanism itself is sound. The minted destination token is also fine — the Hub accepted and processed the request, it just could not reach the source.

Three fixes, and the first two are configuration rather than code. Make the source bucket public, and the implicit public read covers it. Or share the source with the backup account and store one fine-grained token with read on the source and write on both targets as `HF_TOKEN`, which the workflow already prefers over minting; that keeps the token inside the backup account and read-only towards the source, at the cost of rotating it. (Whether buckets support per-repo collaborators is unverified.)

The third is the durable one, and belongs upstream in mi-ni's `templates/backup/backup.py`. `backup_store` already has a download-then-upload path for files the Hub does not track with Xet; make it the fallback for every file when the write client cannot read the source, chosen by one `bucket_info` probe at the top of the leg. That keeps the design's promise that no token spans both accounts. For sca2 it would move 895 MB on the first run and little after — the files are small (median 26 kB, max 74 MB, largest 200 summing to 0.6 GB), so a staged batch of 200 stays well inside a runner's disk.

Fix the diagnostics in the same pass. The batch endpoint returns a per-file reason (`{"success":false,"failed":[{"path":…,"error":…}]}`), and `hf_raise_for_status` discards the body, so `state/last-run.json` recorded only a URL. Reading the response before raising is what turns this class of failure from opaque into obvious.
