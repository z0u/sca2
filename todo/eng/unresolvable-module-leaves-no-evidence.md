# An unresolvable module leaves no evidence and says nothing

Deferred-import evidence is now symbol-granular, so the blast-radius half of this is done. What's left is the failure direction that can actually serve a stale hit: if the `sys.path` search doesn't find a module, `_module_index` returns `None` and the walk moves on — indistinguishable from the stdlib and site-packages, which are meant to be skipped. A task importing something the driver process can't see would then depend on nothing and cache forever. Fixing it means telling "deliberately excluded" from "expected to resolve and didn't", which needs a notion of what should have been findable (an installed-distribution check, or a project-roots list). A warning would be enough. Related smaller assumption: `sys.path` order is taken as stable within a process.

## Notes

**2026-08-16, tech-debt session** — Done as the warning. `_should_have_resolved` decides by the *root* package, which is what says whose code a name is: if the root resolves to a project file, a missing leaf under it is a hole (`from sca.thing import x` after `thing` moved); if the root resolves to nothing at all, `sys.stdlib_module_names` and `importlib.metadata.packages_distributions()` are what separate a C extension from an absence. Installed metadata is only consulted once a path search has already failed, so the common path is unchanged. Detection-only by design — no fingerprint, key, or evidence moved, so no existing record was invalidated. Checked for false positives by fingerprinting all 174 task-level functions across every `docs/*/experiment.py`: silent. The `sys.path`-stability assumption is untouched; it stays documented on `_module_file`'s docstring, which is where the caching that relies on it lives.
