# Status redraw causes flicker in terminal

When running `mini watch ...`, it draws one row per task, each with a progress bar. The first bar updates OK, but the others all flicker when they are redrawn.

```
❯ mini watch ex-2.2.1
score_run-0d869395648e                     ━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00
score_run-1b4eea3e6d55  !! IndexError: ... ━━━━━━━━   0% 0:00:00
score_run-3fd612c1f6d3                     ━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00
```

Perhaps it needs to be batched into a single update or [un]buffered.

Observed in VS Code. Unsure if it happens in other terminal emulators.
