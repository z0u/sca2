# Blend modes in matplotlib figures

matplotlib has no `mix-blend-mode` — no compositing operators on artists at all. Where several series coincide (e.g. the RGB channels in ex-2.1.4's answer-schedule), the last one drawn wins and the rest are hidden. `mini.vis.smooth_step` sidesteps it with tapered line widths, which works but encodes an arbitrary draw order in the widths. A real multiply/screen is possible: render each series to its own RGBA buffer and composite in numpy. Two things to get right if we build it — the chrome (axes, grid, text) must be a separate layer that is not blended, or labels over- and under-expose; and each layer's empty pixels must contribute the mode's identity (1 for multiply, 0 for screen) rather than the background color, or the background gets blended in once per layer. That second one only shows up in dark mode, since empty-over-white happens to equal multiply's identity. Subline gets all of this free because SVG has the property natively ([`subline.py`](../../src/subline/subline.py) sets `--blend-mode` and applies it to the series paths only) — worth revisiting if a second figure wants it.
