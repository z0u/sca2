# The `report-review` skill's `context: fork` frontmatter drops the Agent tool

Forked skill executions don't carry `Agent`, so the runbook's "spawn the reviewer subagent" step can't run locally; the ex-2.1.11 round-1 fork fell back to `create_session`, spawning a remote CCR session. That costs real coordination: separate clone (staged edits can't be read by the lead; they round-trip through a pushed side branch), no `send_message` tool in the lead session (messages go via a `create_trigger(persistent_session_id=…)` + `fire_trigger` poke), no completion notification (the lead polls on a `send_later` timer), and a race if the fork spawns the reviewer before the branch is pushed (happened: the reviewer blocked on a missing branch). Fixes to consider: let forks keep `Agent`; or drop `context: fork` from report-review; or make the runbook say "local reviewer agent first, remote session only as fallback — and push the branch before spawning it."
