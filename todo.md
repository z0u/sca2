# Todo

Scratchpad for deferred work that isn't worth a tracking issue yet. When something
here grows real, promote it to a GitHub issue and remove it from this list.

Scratch items sit under _Scratch_; everything below that is the prioritized
index into GitHub issues. Durable design rationale and recorded
decisions live in [`eng/`](./eng/README.md); each open issue
also carries a grounding comment with current file:line refs, so it should be
readable cold without re-deriving code state.

## Scratch

- **Publish-tier exports go stale on rename.** `export_key` derives from the
  docs-relative path, so moving a notebook orphans its synced bundle: the build
  looks for the new key, skips with a warning, and the site 404s while
  `index.md` still links the page. The `docs/m1/` casualties (ex-2.9.1..4,
  stranded by 31e103e) were moved to their new keys on 2026-07-14;
  `exports/ngpt-sweep` (notebook renamed to ngpt-scaling) is still there as
  pure cruft. Prevention: teach `./go publish` (or the build) to list remote
  export keys and warn on ones with no matching notebook, and/or a `./go
  publish --move old new` verb. Consider folding orphan cleanup into
  `mini gc --store`.

- **PR publishes land on the prod publish tier.** `./go publish` from a PR
  branch writes `exports/<key>/` on the *production* tier — a new report sits
  there dark until main links it (fine; the PR preview even depends on it),
  but re-publishing an *existing* key from a branch silently swaps the assets
  under the live site's stale HTML. If that bites, publish PR exports to a
  `pr-<n>` git revision of the dataset repo (`upload_folder(revision=...)`,
  preview `<base>` at `resolve/pr-<n>/`). PR previews themselves shipped
  2026-07-14 (`pr-preview.yml`; see eng/publishing.md).

- Cross-experiment lineage is now **auto-detected**: `set_ref` in a task worker
  stamps producer identity onto the ref (via an ambient `producer_context`, so
  the project-shared `Store` stays experiment-agnostic), `get_ref` records the
  resolution on the task record (`upstream_refs`), and the driver rolls both
  into `lineage.upstreams`. `Experiment(deps=[...])` remains for upstreams a run
  doesn't read via a ref. Known gaps: refs written by the interactive
  `Apparatus` (`app.map` in a notebook) or driver-side code are unstamped, and
  a consumer served entirely from memo hits records nothing new — its
  previously-recorded `upstream_refs` persist on the old records, which is
  usually what you want. Pre-existing refs (e.g. the m1 `reports/*` ones) stay
  unstamped until their publish step re-runs, so their report footers are empty
  for now.

- Modal `mem_total_gb` in a task's `env` reads the *host* total from
  `/proc/meminfo` (gvisor shows the whole node, ~186–363 GB), not the container's
  memory limit. Fine as a coarse "what class of machine" signal; if we ever want
  the true per-container cap, read the requested `memory=` from the role config
  instead (or the cgroup limit, if gvisor exposes it).

- Calibrate the redirect's γ against the model's pre-norm activation scale
  instead of the fixed γ = 1. Ex-2.9.3 found the fixed value silently no-ops
  on ~1 run in 250 (the bias fails to dominate that seed's pre-norm residual,
  so "deleted" red passes through nearly untouched); ex-2.9.2 saw the same
  once. Cheap fix: set γ to a multiple of the ablated row's typical pre-norm
  contribution, measured on the train set after training.

- `mini.temporal` can't drive feedback control. `DynamicProp.set()` retargets
  mid-flight from the current (value, velocity) state — exactly what a
  controller needs — but experiments consume schedules via `realize_timeline`,
  which bakes the dopesheet into a static per-step array before training, and
  the dopesheet's own keyframes would fight any runtime `set()` calls on the
  same prop. Ex-2.9.4's controller therefore lives inside the training loop
  (duals in the `lax.scan` carry), with the dopesheet still driving the
  non-controlled props. If feedback-driven weights become standard, consider a
  Timeline mode where a prop is declared "controlled": keyframes set its
  *bounds/defaults* and a callback supplies the live value.

- ex-2.9.3's `publish_results` publishes `exemplar-hot`/`exemplar-cool` refs
  (the worst catastrophic run and its cooled-LR rescue) that no report reads.
  Either add the intended before/after rescue figure to the ex-2.9.3 report
  (mirroring ex-2.9.2's exemplar plot) or drop the two `set_ref` calls and the
  `worst`/`rescue` computation.

- Sweep cells all `save_checkpoint` to the same shared `get_data_dir()`, so the
  checkpoint file is last-writer-wins across a fan-out. Harmless today (the
  ngpt-scaling cells return their metrics; nothing reads the checkpoints back),
  but key checkpoints by cell label before any experiment resumes from or
  evaluates them.

- ngpt-scaling shows the simplified nGPT (fixed scalar α = 1/n_layer) trains
  flat across the width × depth grid we can afford. Follow-up: confirm the fixed
  scalar gate holds at a genuinely larger size (wider/deeper than 128×12, bigger
  GPU + batch) before leaning on it for M3.

- Remove the remaining mi-ni template *experiments* (`docs/pipeline`,
  `docs/probe`, `docs/acts` — their report notebooks are already gone) once the
  e2e tests that drive them (`tests/mini/test_experiments_e2e.py`) get their own
  fixtures, or once the first real M2 experiments can play that role. Ties into
  #45 (docs rework). (`docs/gpt-sweep` has since become `docs/ngpt-scaling`, a
  real Iteration 0 output rather than a template.)

## Backlog, grouped by what a single dev session should bundle

**M2 science.**

- [sca2#10](https://github.com/z0u/sca2/issues/10) — D2.1 kickoff: carry-over
  lessons and hypothesis queue from ex-2.9.3/2.9.4 (schedule ordering, the
  fallback analog, γ calibration, superposition watch-outs). Read before
  designing the first transformer anchoring experiment.

**Quick wins.** All shipped: #39 and #36 (PR #51), #19 (queued ≠ running,
PR #54), #47 (per-experiment backend memory for `--app`).

**Storage/control-plane design.** These stem from the same list in
[`eng/decisions.md`](./eng/decisions.md):

- #38 — publish-tier hardening (private-CAS/public-publish bucket split;
  citable versioned publish via a dataset repo). Only matters once the template
  is used for work that shouldn't be world-readable by default.
- Settled: #46 shipped (gen-fenced `set_ref`/`publish` + `StaleWriteError`,
  PR #56). #37 (implicit cross-experiment dedup + shared working volume) closed
  as not planned — the explicit ref path covers reuse; reopen only if
  identical-prep recompute becomes a real recurring cost.

**Sequence after the above:**

- #15 — GC across the control plane, I/O-plane volume dirs, and the CAS.
  Shipped in two cuts: the local per-experiment control-plane + I/O-plane sweep
  (`mini gc <name>`, PR #49), then the Modal Volume sweep and the CAS
  mark-and-sweep (`mini gc --store`, PR #60). Rationale and safety posture in
  [`eng/gc.md`](./eng/gc.md). Only #38 (bucket split) would
  still reshape the CAS leg; the `mini-hf-cache` Volume (#50) stays out of scope
  (pure cache — `modal volume delete mini-hf-cache` is a safe reset).

**Orthogonal, no code overlap with the above:**

- #45 — docs rework. Touches `docs/`, `README.md`, `eng/`, not `src/mini/`.
  Can run in parallel with anything.
- #57 — CLI DevX: tier 1 shipped (`_load_experiment_or_hint` gives a friendly
  error + the `path` positional documents file-vs-NAME). Anything beyond that
  (e.g. auto-resolving a name to its experiment file) is still open.
