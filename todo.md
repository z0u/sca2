# Todo

Scratchpad for deferred work that isn't worth a tracking issue yet. When something
here grows real, promote it to a GitHub issue and remove it from this list.

Scratch items sit under _Scratch_; everything below that is the prioritized
index into GitHub issues. Durable design rationale and recorded
decisions live in [`eng/`](./eng/README.md); each open issue
also carries a grounding comment with current file:line refs, so it should be
readable cold without re-deriving code state.

## Scratch

- `test_publish_serves_with_content_type_from_extension` fails: an anonymous
  GET of the *store bucket's* `published/` revision now returns 401 (the
  publish repo `z0u/sca2-pub` still serves 200 anonymously — verified
  2026-07-09). Looks like a stale test assumption from before exports were
  routed to the publish repo (#38); either point the test at the publish
  tier or drop the anonymous-serving assertion for the bucket.

- Remove the remaining mi-ni template *experiments* (`docs/pipeline`,
  `docs/probe`, `docs/acts`, `docs/gpt-sweep` — their report notebooks are
  already gone) once the e2e tests that drive them
  (`tests/mini/test_experiments_e2e.py`) get their own fixtures, or once the
  first real M2 experiments can play that role. Ties into #45 (docs rework).

## Backlog, grouped by what a single dev session should bundle

**Quick wins.** All shipped: #39 and #36 (PR #51), #19 (queued ≠ running,
PR #54), #47 (per-experiment backend memory for `--app`).

**Storage/control-plane design.** These stem from the same list in
[`eng/decisions.md`](./eng/decisions.md):

- #38 — publish-tier hardening (private-CAS/public-publish bucket split;
  citable versioned publish via a dataset repo). Only matters once the template
  is used for work that shouldn't be world-readable by default.
- Settled: #46 shipped (gen-fenced `set_ref`/`publish` + `StaleWriteError`,
  PR #56). #37 (implicit cross-experiment dedup + shared working volume) closed
  as not planned — the explicit ref path covers reuse; reopen only if
  identical-prep recompute becomes a real recurring cost.

**Sequence after the above:**

- #15 — GC across the control plane, I/O-plane volume dirs, and the CAS.
  Shipped in two cuts: the local per-experiment control-plane + I/O-plane sweep
  (`mini gc <name>`, PR #49), then the Modal Volume sweep and the CAS
  mark-and-sweep (`mini gc --store`, PR #60). Rationale and safety posture in
  [`eng/gc.md`](./eng/gc.md). Only #38 (bucket split) would
  still reshape the CAS leg; the `mini-hf-cache` Volume (#50) stays out of scope
  (pure cache — `modal volume delete mini-hf-cache` is a safe reset).

**Orthogonal, no code overlap with the above:**

- #45 — docs rework. Touches `docs/`, `README.md`, `eng/`, not `src/mini/`.
  Can run in parallel with anything.
- #57 — CLI DevX: passing a name to `retry`/`run` dies with a raw traceback
  (tick verbs take a file, read verbs a name). Tier 1 (friendly error + help
  text on the `path` positional) is a quick win in `src/mini/__main__.py`.
