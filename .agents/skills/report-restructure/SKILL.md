We are reshaping prose so it can be read quickly. We are not checking numbers or
claims.

## Workflow

1. Stage the file first, unless you have another way to see what changed.
2. Find the line range for the section. Give the `report-restructure` agent the
   path and that range, and nothing else — no experiment context, no
   conversation history. It works better without them, and its judgement about
   what is load-bearing has to come from the page rather than from you.
3. When it returns, run the check:

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/report-restructure/scripts/check-templates docs/m2/ex-2.1.7/report.py
   ```

   It parses the file, which catches a dropped brace, a stray brace, or an
   undoubled LaTeX brace, and it lists every template expression that went
   missing. A lost expression is not automatically wrong, since deleting a
   sentence takes its expressions with it, but each one is a place to confirm
   the value was removed rather than frozen.
4. Read the diff for correctness. Two things the agent cannot catch:
   - A qualifier or a hedge that went quiet. It is told the text is correct, so
     it will not notice that "would start to matter" became "matters".
   - A referring expression whose antecedent left with a deleted sentence.
5. Measure, rather than reading the agent's summary. Agents doing this work
   consistently misjudge how much they changed, in both directions, and
   consistently overstate what they preserved. `git diff --stat` and the
   template check take a second each.
6. Report the flavor of the changes, not the details; those are in the diff.

## What this pass is worth

Roughly 2 to 20% of a section's words, and most of the gain is in shape rather
than length. How much depends on what the section is made of: a section that is
40% figure captions, alt text, and tables has little that can move, because all
three are protected. A section of unbroken prose has more.

If a report needs to lose real weight, this is the wrong pass. Duplication
across sections and front matter that runs before the first result are worth
several times more, and they are only visible in the assembled document — that
is the `report-structure` agent's job.

## Where the register came from

The house register for these sections is lab notes, written up: short
paragraphs opening on their findings, colons carrying figure keys, lists kept
inline. The agent's spec describes it, along with the rule that decides how far
to compress: against the immediate context, never against the sentence being
deleted.

That rule was worked out by running several designs over one section whose
failure modes were known, so it is a description of what held up rather than a
preference. The short version: a trim is safe when everything needed to
understand what remains is still on the page nearby, and unsafe when recovering
the meaning needs the sentence that just left.
