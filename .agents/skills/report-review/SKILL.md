  Iterative fresh-eyes review of an experiment report — a preregistration draft
  or design doc before the run, or a filled-in report after it. Use when the
  user wants a report reviewed or sanity-checked, or wants to know whether it is
  ready to run, to freeze, or to publish.

<!--
Runs inline, not `context: fork`. A fork loses the `Agent` tool, and the
runbook's whole shape is "spawn a fresh reviewer subagent per round" —
without `Agent` that falls back to a remote CCR session per reviewer, which
costs a side-branch round-trip for staged edits and races the reviewer
against the branch push. The router doesn't review, so it doesn't need a
fresh context of its own; only the reviewer does, and `Agent` gives it one.
-->

Let's iteratively improve this report.

Your job is to route and decide, not to review. Probably don't read the report yourself — a fresh reader is the whole point.

The loop below is the runbook. For the reasoning behind it — why the two passes ask different questions, and why a reviewer's `Tensions` field stops with you while its `REVIEW` notes travel on — see `references/review-passes.md` in the `science` skill.

First pick the reviewer, since the two ask different questions:

- `prereg-reviewer`: the report has no results yet. Is the design sound and worth running as specified?
- `results-reviewer`: the results have landed. Do they support the claims, and can a fresh reader follow the report? This one also looks at the rendered figures unless you tell it not to.

The experiment run leaves a signal:

- No `experiment.py` beside the report, or one marked `DESIGN_ONLY = True` → prereg. The skeleton is written before the DAG by design, and a design module that holds only constants declares itself with that marker.
- The report resolves no refs (no `get_refs` / `load_results` in the setup cell) → prereg. There is nothing for it to read yet.
- Otherwise, resolve the refs. From the report's directory:

  ```bash
  uv run python -c "
  import experiment as ex
  from mini.store import project_store
  s = project_store()
  print({k: v is not None for k, v in s.get_refs([ex.METRICS_REF]).items()})"
  ```

  Present → the run published, so `results-reviewer`. Use the ref names the report's own loader uses. Don't substitute `bin/mini ls`: it reads local launch state only, so a run made in another checkout reads as absent.

Placeholders left in a report whose refs resolve mean it is mid-fill, not mid-prereg — reports get written one hypothesis at a time. That case gets the `results-reviewer` over the sections that are done; it is the normal state while a report is being written.

Then, for up to 3 rounds:

1. Spawn a fresh reviewer agent of the chosen type. It starts with an empty context, so give it:
    - The file path (and the experiment module beside it, if there is one).
    - Anything the user said should change about the review's focus this round.
    - Whether the numbers have already been verified against the experiment code, so it doesn't re-derive arithmetic without cause.
    - For a `results-reviewer`: which analysis sections are filled and in scope this round, since reports get written one hypothesis at a time and a `TODO` in a section whose turn hasn't come is not a finding.
    - A one-line summary of what the *previous* round changed, so it doesn't redo that work blind — but not the previous round's reasoning or verdict, so its judgment stays independent. The reasoning it is allowed to see is whatever the previous round wrote into the report as a `REVIEW` note, which is part of the artifact rather than context you are leaking.
2. Read its report (`Changes` / `Tensions` / `Blockers` / `Recommendation`).
3. Decide whether to continue:
    - No blockers, and only minor or no changes: stop, this has converged.
    - Real fixes, but it recommends running, freezing, or publishing as-is: stop, this also counts as converged.
    - Something structural it couldn't fix itself, a design question, or a disagreement about how a result should be read: stop and escalate to the user.
    - It reversed something an earlier round decided, or it reports a claim pulling in two directions: stop and escalate. Another round will flip it back. Put both readings to the user and say what would separate them: splitting the hypothesis into two tracks, dropping one, or narrowing its scope. Only the human can make that call, since it changes what the experiment claims.
    - Otherwise (substantive fixes, not yet at "no blockers"): another round.
4. If the loop converged and the report is heading for a freeze or a publish, export the document and give it to the `report-structure` agent. Reviewers edit one section at a time, so duplication between sections, a tl;dr that has grown into a second conclusion, and a findings section that a result never reached only show up in the assembled render. It proposes rather than edits, so bring its cut list to the user rather than acting on it — deleting a paragraph is their call. Skip this step when you escalated: the text will move again.

   Read the render, not the source. A cell can fail to render and leave no trace in `report.py`; ex-2.1.7 published without its H2 verdict that way.
5. After the loop ends (converged, escalated, or 3 rounds reached), summarize for the user: what changed across all rounds, any open questions, and the final recommendation. Include `git diff --stat` for the report so they can see the size of the change, and list any `REVIEW` notes the rounds added — those are decisions the reviewers made on their own authority, and the user should get the chance to overrule them. Leave the diff staged rather than committed, and offer to commit.
