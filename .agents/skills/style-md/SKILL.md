  Syntax conventions for Markdown, and renderer-specific pitfalls to avoid. Read
  before editing text in .md files, literate-script reports, and GitHub issues.

Wrapping: keep each paragraph on one line — very wide — and let the editor soft-wrap it; don't hard-wrap at a fixed column. Exceptions below. For paragraphs that contain landmarks, like inline lists, put the landmarks after a single newline:

> This is a paragraph with an inline list:
> (a) Foo,
> (b) Bar.

## Links

A target starting with `/` resolves from the **repository** root, not the filesystem or domain root — GitHub rewrites it to the current ref, and VS Code resolves it against the workspace root. Prefer that form whenever a link leaves its own directory: `/eng/determinism.md` says where it lands, where `../../../../eng/determinism.md` only says how far to climb. Keep `./sibling.md` for a file alongside, and `../` where the relationship is the point — a `references/` doc pointing at the `SKILL.md` that owns it, or one backlog set pointing at another.

An `#anchor` into a heading works in both places, since GitHub and the published site slug a heading the same way. Add an explicit `<span id="user-content-..."></span>` to a heading only when the link has to survive the heading being reworded — a link from a published post, say.

`./go links` reports a target whose file is missing, an `#anchor` that no longer matches a heading. It's part of `./go check` and gates CI, so run it after renaming a heading or moving a file — the moved file gives a dead link, but the renamed heading is the quiet one, since the link still opens the file at the top and the reader lands somewhere plausible.

## GitHub

In pull requests and issues, single newlines are retained — whereas in `.md` files they are collapsed. So don't hard-wrap paragraphs in issues and PRs.

Math expressions are OK; slight preference for plain Unicode because it's easier to copy.

## Literate scripts

`mini.lit`'s Markdown dialect has some extensions. Consider using `details` and footnotes for asides:

```py
r"""
Main content with an inline footnote,[^note] and so on.

[^note]: Shows beside its marker: in the margin on a wide screen and in the PDF, on hover on a narrow one. Footnote numbers restart per document.

/// details | Title
Some backstory.
///
"""
```

A footnote made only of paragraphs becomes a margin note; one holding a list or code stays in the list at the end, and so does one cited from a table cell, a caption or a heading (it shows on hover).

Glossary terms are annotated for you. The first use of each term in every `##` section carries its definition as a margin note, taken from the report's own `## Glossary` section and then from `docs/glossary.md`, the shared dictionary. Both are definition lists, in Markdown syntax (the term, then `:   definition` on the next line) or as a `<dl>`. Another term line above the same definition adds a wording, and so do commas and parentheses within one. Matching is whole-word and case-insensitive, and skips code, links, headings, tables and captions. `[the spread](term:band)` marks a use in other words, or of a term kept off auto-matching (`Band {.manual}`, for everyday words). Mechanics: `src/mini/lit/notes.py`.

Prefer a glossary term to a footnote when the aside defines a word the reader will meet again: the definition then shows beside the word in every section, and other reports can share it. A term whose meaning holds across reports goes in `docs/glossary.md`, and one used in a narrower sense goes in the report's own glossary. Keep footnotes for one-off asides, such as a caveat, a source, or a side calculation.

Lead each footnote and definition with a few words to jog the memory, as a short first sentence or a head before a colon ("Exponential moving average: a running average that …"). That lead is the gloss. On a wide screen the margin shows only the gloss until the note is hovered or focused. On paper the margin only ever shows the gloss: footnotes print in full in the list at the end, but a shared definition prints nowhere else, so its gloss has to stand on its own.

Other admonition types and their icons: `details` (folds, unobtrusive), `admonition` (unadorned), `note` ℹ️, `tip` 💡, `important` 💬, `warning` ⚠️, `error` 🛑. The `| title` is optional, except for `details`.

A document weaves top to bottom in file order, so a heading is always where it's written — there's no DAG-ordering concern about when a cell renders relative to its neighbours.

Math expressions, for consistency with formulas. Unicode can be used where it's cumbersome to use math mode, e.g. in embedded HTML.

Text-wrapping.
- Beware of interpolated f-strings that would put special syntax at the start of a line. A line that starts with `{value:d}. Next sentence` will render as an ordered list, even if `value` is not 1.
- Don't hard-wrap a line inside an inline code span  `` ` `` or math expression `$`. A wrapped span might start the next line with block syntax, so a hex code in an expression like ` #f78` renders as a heading, and some renderers break the span entirely. Rewrap the surrounding prose so the whole span sits on one line.

But _do_ use multiline strings; these are automatically `dedent`ed:

```patch
- "Sometimes we write Markdown in Python, e.g. in a literate script. "
- "In that case, prefer multiline strings rather than using one string per "
- "hard-wrapped line. Use dedent and f-strings as needed."
+ """
+ Sometimes we write Markdown in Python, e.g. in a literate script. In that case, prefer a multiline string over one string literal per hard-wrapped line. Use dedent and f-strings as needed."""
```

Multiline strings are also supported by the `@themed(..., alt_text=..., caption=...)` decorator (see `style-fig`).

### Interpolation and indentation

A prose string is dedented as written, and dedenting never touches the inside of an interpolated value. So an interpolated value keeps whatever indentation was baked into it, and once the surrounding Markdown has been dedented to column 0, four leading spaces in that value make the block a code fence — the table you built renders as its own raw HTML:

```patch
- _r = f"{prose(res)}\n\n    {table(res)}"
- f"""
-     {_r}
- """
+ rf"""
+ {prose(res)}
+
+ {table(res)}
+ """
```

Two rules follow. Build the Markdown inline in the prose string that displays it, rather than assembling pre-formatted fragments in one place and dropping them into a template in another — that puts the indentation somewhere you can't see it. And let every interpolated value be flush left, with no leading whitespace of its own.

### The shape of a section

A section of a report reads best as three pieces: the heading on its own, then the background and prediction, then the results. Guard the results with `stop()` when the data isn't there yet:

```python
if res is None:
    stop(RESULTS_TO_COME)
rf"""
**Results.** {h1_prose(res)}

{h1_figure(res)}
"""
```

`stop()` ends the script there — later cells don't run, and later prose still renders, with every unresolved name shown as a pending mark — so a preregistration reads whole before its results exist. It never returns, so a type checker narrows `res` for everything below the guard.
