description: Python style and typing conventions for this repo — method chaining, modern syntax, where to put type hints, and the literate programming standard for reports. Use when writing or reviewing any Python.
---

House style, in three lines: chain your calls, use the newest syntax the toolchain accepts, and keep it short.

## Shape of the code

Prefer JavaScript-style method chaining, even in Python. Put the newline _before_ the dot, and wrap the whole expression in parentheses when you need to:

```python
result = (
    frame
    .filter(pl.col("lam") > 0)
    .group_by("rung")
    .agg(pl.col("mse").mean())
)
```

Prefer brevity. A shorter version that reads the same is the better version.

## Cutting-edge syntax is encouraged

We track new Python releases and use what they give us. For example, PEP 758 multi-exception `except` without parentheses is valid in 3.14:

```python
try:
    pass
except A, B:  # PEP 758
    pass
```

If something looks unfamiliar, check the linters rather than rewriting it. `ruff` and `ty` are the arbiters: if they're happy, the code is fine.

## Typing

Annotate, to give the type-checker something to catch and the IDE something to complete.

Use `T | None`, never `Optional[T]`:

```diff
- foo: Optional[int] = None
+ foo: int | None = None
```

You don't need annotations everywhere. Put one wherever inference would otherwise stall — usually the point where a value first enters the code. That single annotation then carries through everything downstream.

A literate script's cells are ordinary top-level code in one shared namespace — there are no generated function signatures to keep in sync, so annotate the same way you would in any module: wherever inference would otherwise stall, usually where a value first enters the code. A name reused across cells is typed by flow, the same as any reassigned local.

### Matplotlib axes

`plt.subplots()` returns `tuple[Figure, Any]`, because the second element's shape depends on the arguments. `cast()` it to the alias that matches what you asked for:

```python
from mini.vis import AxesRow
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, ...)  # 1D
axes = cast(AxesRow, axes)

from mini.vis import AxesGrid
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, ...)  # 2D
axes = cast(AxesGrid, axes)
```

## JAX

Jit at module level, never inside a function or loop. JAX caches compiled code per function object, so `eqx.filter_jit(lambda …)` built per call recompiles per call, with whatever it closes over baked in. Pass what varies as arguments, and make a parametrized operator an `eqx.Module` so a new value of the same shape reuses the program. `_forward_jit` in `sca/intervention.py` is the pattern; the mi-ni authoring reference has the rest of the GPU conventions.

## Literate scripts

Our experiments and reports ship code and prose together, as literate scripts (`mini.lit`): the only report form. Aim for literate programming: the Markdown should explain what the next cell does and why, so the report reads as an argument rather than a script with captions.

A literate script is a plain module with a `# title:` header: a top-level string is prose (an f-string where it quotes a value), and the code between two prose strings is a cell. Everything is ordinary Python, so annotate as you would in a module; there are no generated signatures. The conventions that come from the form:

- Prose is the cell boundary. A `# %%` line splits a cell where prose would not fit: two values shown back to back, or a slow loader kept apart from the fast plot beneath it so an edit to the plot re-runs the plot alone.
- An f-string doubles every literal brace, so `\frac{a}{b}` becomes `\frac{{a}}{{b}}` once the paragraph quotes a value. Keep equations in plain (`r"""…"""`) paragraphs and quote values in the paragraph beside them.
- A results table is a helper returning `<table class="report-table">` as the cell's last expression; no scroll wrapper, the table is its own scroll box on a narrow screen.
- Only a cell's last expression is displayed. A loop that builds figures ends the cell with the joined string (`"\n\n".join(...)`); a table is a helper returning HTML as the last expression. The runner refuses a displayable value anywhere else in a cell, so a stray one is an error rather than a silent gap.
- Every top-level string is prose, so a variable docstring under a constant would weave as a paragraph. Write it as a comment (`./go lint` flags the slip).
- One namespace, top to bottom: no `_private` cell names, and a name may be reused across cells (ty types by flow). Precompute joined lists as strings in the cell rather than in the prose field.
- `if cond: stop("…")` ends a preregistration early; the prose below still renders with pending marks for what it cannot evaluate.
- Slow work goes under `@memo`; see "Fast renders" below.

### Fast renders

A report is read as Markdown far more often than it is published (`./go render <report> -o <file>.md`, then read it; the report-render skill), and every one of those reads runs the cells, so a warm render should take about two seconds. Two habits get there, and both are cheap enough to be the default rather than an optimisation:

- **Batch the ref reads.** Each `get_refs`/`get_many` round trip to the bucket costs a fixed few hundred milliseconds, so resolve every ref the report needs in one `get_refs` and pull the files in one `get_many`, then read them from the temp dir (the pattern is in the mi-ni reports reference). Seven refs loaded one at a time is most of a render.
- **`@memo` every figure and every slow computation.** `mini.lit.memo` stacks above `@themed(...)` on the plot function and pickles the result under `.mini/lit-cache/`, so a warm render serves the figure from disk. Anything that should invalidate the cache is either code the function reaches (its body, project helpers it calls, `ex.CONST` module attributes, plain module-level values, NumPy array globals) or one of its arguments, so pass the data the figure draws and the alt text as arguments. A bare `@memo` over a plot function that reads module-level arrays is safe, and the cache warns when a function reads something it cannot fingerprint (a module-level dict of arrays, a project-typed object): move that value into the argument list. Large arguments cost a fingerprint per render (a 30 MB metrics dict is about half a second), so hand a figure the slice it draws rather than the whole results object.

- **Keep the per-render fixed costs small.** A results object assembled from published artifacts can define `__memo_key__()` returning their `sha256`s, and the cache keys it by those instead of digesting every array it holds (ex-2.2.3's `Results`). A big `.npz` goes through `mini.lit.read_npz`, which decompresses arrays on first access and keys by content, so a report that reads twenty of nine thousand entries pays for twenty. And a large loaded dict wants a name no class attribute shares (`metrics_loaded`, with `res.metrics` the accessor): the code-evidence walk reads attribute names as possible globals, and a bare `metrics` global beside a `self.metrics` is digested on every memoized call.
- **Never memoize the load itself.** A ref can move to new data under the same name, which no fingerprint sees; ask the store each render and cache what is computed from the data. Cells that draw from a shared RNG stream (`rng = np.random.default_rng(0)` at module level, consumed in sequence) are also not candidates, since skipping one would change every draw after it.

A converted report and its unconverted twin weave identical Markdown, so verify a speed-up by diffing `index.md` before and after. `./go render` reports `woven in N ms`; profile a slow one with `uv run python -m cProfile -o out.prof -m mini.lit render docs/…/report.py -o /tmp/r/index.md`.
