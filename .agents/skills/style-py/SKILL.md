description: Python style and typing conventions for this repo — method chaining, modern syntax, where to put type hints given that Marimo generates cell signatures, and the literate programming standard for notebooks. Use when writing or reviewing any Python.
---

House style, in three lines: chain your calls, use the newest syntax the toolchain accepts, and keep it short.

## Shape of the code

Prefer JavaScript-style method chaining, even in Python. Put the newline _before_ the dot, and wrap the whole expression in parentheses when you need to:

```python
result = (
    frame
    .filter(pl.col("lam") > 0)
    .group_by("rung")
    .agg(pl.col("mse").mean())
)
```

Prefer brevity. A shorter version that reads the same is the better version.

## Cutting-edge syntax is encouraged

We track new Python releases and use what they give us. For example, PEP 758 multi-exception `except` without parentheses is valid in 3.14:

```python
try:
    pass
except A, B:  # PEP 758
    pass
```

If something looks unfamiliar, check the linters rather than rewriting it. `ruff` and `ty` are the arbiters: if they're happy, the code is fine.

## Typing

Annotate, to give the type-checker something to catch and the IDE something to complete.

Use `T | None`, never `Optional[T]`:

```diff
- foo: Optional[int] = None
+ foo: int | None = None
```

You don't need annotations everywhere. Put one wherever inference would otherwise stall — usually the point where a value first enters the code. That single annotation then carries through everything downstream.

### Marimo cells

Marimo generates cell function signatures, so a parameter is bare unless the cell that _defines_ that value annotated it. Where the parameter is bare, inference has nothing to work from at the top of the cell. Annotate the first local binding and the rest of the cell follows:

```python
@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(RUNGS, grading):
    _rungs: list[str] = [c for c in RUNGS if c != "lam0"]
    _resp: dict[str, tuple[np.ndarray, float, float]] = {c: grading(c) for c in _rungs}
```

Annotate a _public_ name and Marimo copies that annotation onto the parameter list of every cell downstream, the next time it saves the file:

```python
@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(_sv):
    sv_trials: dict[int, dict] = {t["trial"]: t for t in _sv["trials"]}
    return (sv_trials,)


@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(sv_trials: dict[int, dict]):  # Marimo propagated this annotation
    ...
```

Leave them alone: if you add or change them, Marimo will regenerate them and cause churn in Git. Annotate the definition instead.

`marimo check --fix <file>` applies the rewrite from the CLI, and is authoritative over signatures: it fills in missing annotations, corrects wrong ones, and removes any with no annotated definition behind them. It runs automatically on edit (a `PostToolUse` hook) and on commit (via lint-staged), so this mostly self-corrects.

`./go annotations [path...]` names the public cell variables that are still bare, so you can see a notebook's share before you start: `./go annotations docs/m2/ex-2.1.8`. It's advisory — a worklist, not a gate — and it reports names bound by unpacking (`a, b = ...`) separately, since Python has no syntax to annotate those and the fix is to split the statement instead.

Naming:

- Symbols that are cell-local must start with `_`, or Marimo will complain.
- Symbols within nested functions should usually not start with `_`.

```python
@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _():
    def _foo(x: int) -> int:
        y = x + 1
        return y
```

Utilities and setup:

- In general, put imports and constants in a setup cell.
- Put utility functions in their own reusable cells. Don't put them in the setup cell, or editing a function would invalidate every cell in the notebook.

```python
with app.setup(hide_code=True):
    # This is the "setup" cell
    from mini.reports import report_bundle, use_publisher

    use_publisher(report_bundle(__file__))

    SLICE_NAMES = ["emb", "1", "2", "3", "4"]
    """A docstring for a constant."""


@app.function(hide_code=True)
def load_margins() -> tuple[dict[str, dict[str, np.ndarray]], np.ndarray] | None:
    # This is a "reusable function" cell
    ...
    return data
```

### Matplotlib axes

`plt.subplots()` returns `tuple[Figure, Any]`, because the second element's shape depends on the arguments. `cast()` it to the alias that matches what you asked for:

```python
from mini.vis import AxesRow
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, ...)  # 1D
axes = cast(AxesRow, axes)

from mini.vis import AxesGrid
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, ...)  # 2D
axes = cast(AxesGrid, axes)
```

## Notebooks

Our experiments and reports are Marimo notebooks, which means the code and the prose ship together. Iterate on both. Aim for literate programming: the Markdown should explain what the next cell does and why, so the notebook reads as an argument rather than a script with captions.

See the `style-fig` skill for figure and results-table conventions, and `docs/README.md` for file-type and publishing rules.
