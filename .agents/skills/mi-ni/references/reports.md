# Reports

A report is a literate script (`mini.lit`; `docs/**/*.py` opening with a `# title:` header) that reads an experiment's durable results and renders them for the web. Two parts of making one live in the `science` and `sci-report` skills rather than here: fixing what the report will claim *before* the experiment runs (the preregistration discipline), and the passes any report prose goes through once written. This file covers the rest — publishing the report as a self-contained bundle once results land.

## Report bundles

Externalizing a report's figures and data keeps the exported HTML light and publishes off Git LFS. The `publish` store primitive it builds on is in [storage.md](./storage.md#publishing-to-the-web), the `themed` figure hook that feeds it is in [vis.md](./vis.md), and the *why* behind the bundle-plus-`<base>` design is in `eng/publishing.md`.

A report is a _bundle_: one HTML document (woven from the script) plus its heavy assets (figures, data blobs), exported to a self-contained dir and synced to the bucket as a unit. The report script (`docs/**/*.py`) is the only thing in Git; the HTML is never committed.

### Set `# title:`

Every report is conventionally named `report.py` (see [authoring.md](./authoring.md)), so a script with no `# title:` header falls back to its filename stem, publishing every report as "report" (browser tab, bookmark, search result: all indistinguishable). Give the header a real title, matching the report's H1:

```py
# title: Ex 2.1.1: the color-mixing transformer, un-anchored
```

### Produce

The runner installs a `Publisher` for the document before its first cell runs, so every `themed` figure externalizes with no setup in the report (figure code is unchanged). `asset_url` on that publisher is the general verb for any blob a report's JS reads (a large JSON for a data browser, an SPA's data files):

```py
from mini.reports import current_publisher

url = current_publisher().asset_url(points_json, name="points.json")   # -> '_assets/points.json'
```

Each asset is written to `_assets/<name>`, keyed by its readable name, so the URL is stable across re-exports and a re-render overwrites in place (nothing accumulates on the bucket), and a browser "Save as" suggests that name (it takes the URL's last segment; the bucket sets no `Content-Disposition`). Two *different* blobs under one name in an export raises (give each a distinct `name=`).

The runner picks the destination from the context, because the two documents resolve relative URLs against different roots. Exporting, that's the bundle's `_assets/` beside `index.html`. Under `./go serve`, it's a scratch dir keyed to the script (`.mini/lit-live/<key>/`), next to the live page. Both are gitignored. Externalizing while editing too is what lets a figure-heavy report render at all without blowing past a sane page size. Outside the runner (a test, a plain `python report.py`) there is no publisher and figures inline, so a no-frills run still works.

### Consume

A report reads durable results *by name* through `project_store()`, which resolves whichever storage pair is configured — a report never builds a store itself or names a bucket, and every science run's results are on production ([storage.md](./storage.md#which-pair-a-run-uses)). It must also open cleanly before the results exist. Resolve refs in one helper that returns `None` when unpublished, and guard the first data cell with `stop()` showing the command that produces the data — everything after it can then assume results:

```py
def load_results() -> dict | None:
    store = project_store()
    art = store.get_ref(METRICS_REF)         # ref name published by experiment.py
    if art is None:
        return None
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:
        return json.loads(store.get(art, Path(d) / "metrics.json").read_text())

loaded = load_results()
if loaded is None:
    stop("No results yet — run the experiment:\n```bash\nbin/mini run …\n```")
curves = loaded  # re-export under a new name; see below
```

A report that reads several refs (its own metrics and arrays, an earlier experiment's for comparison) resolves them all in one `get_refs` and pulls the files in one `get_many` — the bucket's per-call latency is a few hundred milliseconds, so one round trip per ref makes the render slow to read as Markdown, which is how a report is mostly consumed:

```py
def fetch(refs: Sequence[str], into: Path) -> dict[str, Path | None]:
    """Each ref's published file under *into*, or None before it exists."""
    store = project_store()
    have = {r: a for r, a in store.get_refs(refs).items() if a is not None}
    paths = store.get_many([(a, into / f"{i}-{Path(r).name}") for i, (r, a) in enumerate(have.items())])
    return dict.fromkeys(refs) | dict(zip(have, paths, strict=True))

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as _tmp:
    files = fetch([METRICS_REF, ARRAYS_REF, EX223_METRICS_REF], Path(_tmp))
    loaded = load_results(files)     # typed loaders reading files[REF], so stop() narrowing still works
```

Pair it with `@memo` on every figure (the `style-py` skill, "Fast renders") and a warm render is about two seconds. Read a large `.npz` with `mini.lit.read_npz`, which decompresses each array on first access, and leave the loaders themselves unmemoized: a ref can move to new data under the same name, which no fingerprint sees.

`stop()` halts execution from that point on: later cells don't run, and later prose renders with the names it can't resolve shown as pending marks. So consume the data only through names defined at or after the guard (its re-export, or stats derived there), never through a name that might still be `None`.

Ref names are stringly typed: the experiment `set_ref`s them and the report `get_ref`s them, so declare them once in `experiment.py` and import them from the report (`from experiment import METRICS_REF` — a literate script puts its own directory first on `sys.path`). Sweep constants the report reiterates (widths, seeds) can ride along in the same import. Namespace refs by milestone (`reports/m2/ex-2.1.1/metrics`) so experiments with similar numbering can't collide across milestones.

Provenance is automatic. While the report renders, every `get_ref` it makes is recorded by the active publisher into the bundle's `_assets/provenance.json` (ref → the producer stamped at `set_ref` time: experiment, task, git state, run time — see [storage.md](./storage.md)), and the exporter injects a folded "Data provenance" chip (bottom-left, mirroring the nav banner) citing each producing experiment. No per-report code; a report whose refs are unstamped (written before provenance existed, or outside a task worker) gets no chip until the producing step re-runs. The chip's content derives only from the refs in the store, so re-exporting unchanged data yields the same footer — publishing stays idempotent.

Quote numbers in prose as computed values (an f-string field like `{best:.2f}`), derived at or after the guard, so the text can't drift from the data. And compute the stats *before* writing any qualitative claim — including figure alt text: a placeholder like "the lines nearly coincide" written ahead of the data will survive into a published report saying the opposite of what happened.

### Publish, then build

Two halves, split by trigger. `./go publish` (authenticated) exports each report to `.mini/exports/<key>/` (the page and its `_assets/`) and mirrors that bundle to the bucket at `exports/<key>/` — the heavy half (it runs the report, which needs the data + a write token). This is a deliberate step, *not* something experiment completion does for you: an experiment publishes its *results* to the store, but the *report* bundle ships only when you run `./go publish`, and the build silently skips a report that was never published (a warning, not an error), so the site just quietly lacks it. Publish once the report renders the results. Publishing also pins the bundle's revision (a publish-tier commit sha) in `docs/publish.lock`; commit that file with your changes, since the site serves each report at its pinned revision, so the publish deploys nothing until the pin lands on main (a PR preview serves the branch's pins meanwhile). The site build prints each report's `report.pdf` beside its page (`./go render <report> -o .mini/prints/<name>.pdf` prints the same page for review, stamped with its commit; hand that to the human with `SendUserFile` when a draft is ready to annotate on e-ink), reusing the previous build's file when nothing it prints from has changed. A PR preview also borrows production's PDF for every report the PR did not touch, so a science PR prints only its own reports; a PR that edits `report.css` or the print tooling reprints them all, once.

Publish when you open or update a PR that touches a report, once you're reasonably happy with it; it needn't be perfect. The PR preview serves the branch's pinned bundle, so publishing (and committing the bumped `publish.lock`) is what lets a reviewer see your change rendered; skip it and the preview shows the *old* report while your diff claims otherwise. Re-run `./go publish` and commit the lock bump on each round of report edits you push. `scripts/build_site.py` (read-only; CI) then *pulls* each synced bundle at its pinned revision, resolves author links against the repo, and inserts one `<base href="…/exports/<key>/">` in the `<head>` so the relative `_assets/…` URLs resolve at the bucket — no per-URL rewriting, no bucket writes. The same HTML opened locally (after `./go preview`, which exports the bundle and reassembles the site) resolves `_assets/…` to the co-located files (offline; real PNGs), because the build *localizes* when there's no bucket. Each report is one independently syncable bundle, served at `<key>/`.

Because `<base>` repoints *every* relative URL, the rule is that the only relative URLs in a report are its assets. Author-written nav/source links would break against the bucket, so `build_site` resolves them: a link to another report or `.md` becomes its rendered page, a link to a source file becomes its GitHub source, and anything it can't place is left alone with a warning. Write natural relative links (`[experiment](./experiment.py)`); the absolute targets are derived from the git remote (override with `MINI_SITE_URL` / `MINI_SOURCE_URL`). Design notes: `eng/publishing.md`.

## Verifying a rendered report from a sandboxed agent session

Headless Chromium *does* render an exported bundle here, and the report-render skill is the how. Reach for it to screenshot a report — layout, prose, figures in situ — or to assert on client-side behavior (the show-code toggle, visibility logic) via Playwright DOM queries. Commands, DOM-driving, and gotchas live in that skill.

For a quick check you often don't need a browser at all:

- Structure: grep `index.html` for `Traceback`, which should have zero hits, and for a string produced *past* the `stop()` guard (a computed number, a section heading), which proves the data cells ran. Beware that cell *source* is embedded in the HTML too when `# code: show` is set, so grep for rendered output, not code.
- Figures: `Read` the exported `_assets/<name>-{light,dark}.png` itself — faster and more faithful than a screenshot when you only care about one figure. Judge the dark variant composited over `#111` (see the style-fig skill).
- Inline SVG output (e.g. subline): if the report wraps the chunk in `externalize_html(html, name=…)` (mini.reports), the same markup is also a plain file at `_assets/<name>.html` — `Read` it instead of digging through the session JSON. A Markdown render carries a link to it, described by the figure's `aria-label`, in place of the markup. To *see* it, extract the `<svg>…</svg>` and rasterize with cairosvg (`uvx --with cairosvg`), first stripping any external `@import url(...)` font rule. Glyph metrics are approximate without the webfont (text drifts relative to per-character marks), but shape and story read fine. Simpler still: regenerate the SVG standalone with the same code and data the report uses — that also exercises the figure code path. (For a *faithful* shot with webfonts, `render.py --selector '.output svg'` shoots the element straight from the rendered report — see the report-render skill.)

Need to drive Chromium for something outside a report bundle (a self-contained page)? `render.py` is the reference — copy its serve-root + Playwright setup, which already encodes the sandbox specifics (the `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` executable, serving over localhost, `domcontentloaded` for pages that touch external hosts).
