"""
Notebook utilities for rendering themed matplotlib figures as HTML.

A report's figures are heavy (a themed plot is *two* PNGs, light and dark). Inlined
as ``data:`` URIs they bloat the exported HTML — the bytes Git LFS used to carry. A
:class:`~mini.reports.Publisher` instead writes each blob out as a file beside the
report (keyed by its readable name) and references it by a **relative** URL, so the
report HTML stays light. Set one up once per report and every ``@themed`` figure
externalizes with no per-figure ceremony::

    # in the report's setup cell
    from mini.vis import themed
    from mini.reports import use_publisher, report_bundle
    use_publisher(report_bundle(__file__))

    # in a figure cell — unchanged
    @themed(alt_text='…')
    def _plot(): ...
    mo.Html(_plot())

The relative reference is the point: the *same* HTML works both ways. Opened locally
it resolves to the co-located ``_assets/`` files (offline, and the figures are real
PNG files); published, ``scripts/build_site.py`` uploads those files to the HF bucket
and inserts a single ``<base href>`` so the very same relative URLs resolve there. A
report with no publisher inlines as self-contained ``data:`` URIs, as before. The
publisher and the bundle protocol live in :mod:`mini.reports`.
