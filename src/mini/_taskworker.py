"""
Detached worker for a single memoized task: ``python -m mini._taskworker <data_dir> <key>``.

Loads the cloudpickled call, runs it with the data-dir + progress context (so
``get_data_dir``/``emit_progress``/``emit_metrics`` work), and records the
result or traceback under the content key. Spawned in its own session so it
outlives the orchestration tick that launched it.

    Shared by the local subprocess worker and the Modal remote worker: only how
    the call *arrives* (staged on disk vs passed to ``spawn``) and where state
    lands (``RecordStore``) differ; the run/persist core is identical.

    *gen* is the attempt generation this worker runs under. Every record write is
    fenced on it, and the result/error land in gen-qualified files — so a stale
    worker (superseded by a relaunch, or cancelled but surviving SIGTERM) can
    neither merge DONE over its successor's RUNNING nor overwrite its result. A
    worker that finds itself already superseded at startup exits without running.

    *commit* is called after the result/error is written to the I/O plane and
    *before* the record flips to DONE/FAILED — so a poller never sees a settled
    state whose artifact hasn't been committed yet (the Modal Volume needs this).

    *artifacts* binds the content-addressed :class:`~mini.store.Store` as ambient
    for ``mini.store.put`` / ``get`` inside the step. Because ``put`` uploads
    synchronously, by the time the result is written its handles already resolve —
    so the existing write → commit → DONE order extends from "the volume flushed"
    to "the referenced blobs are durable" for free. Its mutable-name verbs
    (``set_ref`` / ``publish``) are fenced on *gen* via :class:`_FencedStore`, so
    a stale worker fails loudly instead of clobbering a name its successor owns.
