"""
Drive a memoized experiment to completion with a live Rich progress display.

``mini run <exp> --watch`` ticks the orchestration to launch each stage, then
*polls the durable memo records* (never re-ticking to poll — see todo, "Keep
`tick` (drive) distinct from polling (read)") and renders a live bar per task
until the in-flight set settles, advancing the DAG stage by stage until done.

Ctrl-C only stops *watching*: the task workers are detached subprocesses, so
they keep running. Re-running the same command reattaches — completed steps are
memo hits and in-flight tasks aren't relaunched — so monitoring just resumes.

      liveness went stale (stale heartbeat / frozen step, held across two
      consecutive polls — the thresholds themselves are the debounce);
    - ``"timeout"`` — *timeout* seconds elapsed with work still in flight.
