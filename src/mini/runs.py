"""
Shared durable-state primitives for the memoized orchestration.

The control plane is small, hot, last-writer-wins JSON (per-task state, metrics,
heartbeat); the I/O plane holds the large artifacts. This module owns the bits
both planes and both backends need: the ``RunState`` enum, atomic/merge JSON
writes (so concurrent readers never see a half-written file), and the detached
task-worker spawn. The rest of the state model lives in ``mini.memo``.
