Report bundles: produce a report's assets as relative URLs, then repoint them.

A report is a **bundle** — one HTML document (woven by ``mini.lit``) plus its heavy assets (figures, data blobs). The two halves of the bundle protocol both live here:

**Produce.** A :class:`Publisher` writes each asset out as a file beside the exported HTML and hands back a *relative* URL like ``_assets/<name>.png``. The path is the asset's readable name (so a browser saving it suggests a sensible filename — the URL's last segment, since the bucket sets no ``Content-Disposition``), and the name *is* the key, so a re-render overwrites in place and the URL stays stable. ``themed`` figures externalize through a publisher when one is set; :meth:`Publisher.asset_url` is the general verb for any blob.

**Publish.** That same HTML is consumed two ways:

- **opened locally**, the relative URL resolves to the co-located ``_assets/`` files;
- **served from Pages**, we want it to resolve to the assets we uploaded to the HF bucket instead.

The bridge is a single ``<base href>`` in the ``<head>`` (:func:`insert_base`): it sets the document base that *every* relative URL resolves against, so one inserted tag repoints the whole report's assets at the bucket — no per-URL rewriting, and it works for a relative ``fetch()`` too.

The catch is that ``<base>`` is document-global, so an author-written relative *link* (a markdown ``[src](./experiment.py)``) would be repointed too — and 404 against the bucket. :func:`stray_links` finds those at build time; :func:`rewrite_links` turns them into absolute targets (their rendered page, or their source) so they survive the base. The convention is *the only relative URLs left in a report are store assets*.
