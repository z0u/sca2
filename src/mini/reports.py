Report bundles: produce a report's assets as relative URLs, then repoint them.

A report is a **bundle** — one Marimo HTML document plus its heavy assets (figures, data blobs). The two halves of the bundle protocol both live here:

**Produce.** A :class:`Publisher` writes each asset out as a file beside the exported HTML and hands back a *relative* URL like ``_assets/<name>.png``. (Interactively there's no exported HTML to sit beside, so :func:`report_bundle` aims the same publisher at the notebook's ``public/.mini/`` and hands back the URL marimo's kernel serves that file from — see :func:`public_dir`.) The path is the asset's readable name (so a browser saving it suggests a sensible filename — the URL's last segment, since the bucket sets no ``Content-Disposition``), and the name *is* the key, so a re-render overwrites in place and the URL stays stable. ``themed`` figures externalize through a publisher when one is set; :meth:`Publisher.asset_url` is the general verb for any blob.

**Publish.** That same HTML is consumed two ways:

- **opened locally**, the relative URL resolves to the co-located ``_assets/`` files;
- **served from Pages**, we want it to resolve to the assets we uploaded to the HF bucket instead.

The bridge is a single ``<base href>`` in the ``<head>`` (:func:`insert_base`): it sets the document base that *every* relative URL resolves against, so one inserted tag repoints the whole report's assets at the bucket — no per-URL rewriting, and it works for the data URIs buried in Marimo's session JSON and a relative ``fetch()`` alike.

The catch is that ``<base>`` is document-global, so an author-written relative *link* (a markdown ``[src](./experiment.py)``) would be repointed too — and 404 against the bucket. :func:`stray_links` finds those at build time; :func:`rewrite_links` turns them into absolute targets (their rendered page, or their source) so they survive the base. The convention is *the only relative URLs left in a report are store assets*.

    Both contexts externalize; they differ only in where the files land and what the relative URL is, because the two documents resolve URLs against different roots:

    - **exporting** (:func:`exporting`) — the bundle's ``_assets/`` under :func:`export_dir`, so ``_assets/<name>`` resolves next to the exported ``index.html`` (and, once published, against the ``<base href>`` pointing at the bucket).
    - **interactive** ``marimo edit`` — :func:`public_dir`, so the file lands at ``public/.mini/<stem>/<name>``, and the URL is the kernel-served ``@file/`` one (``virtualize``, which sidesteps the per-browser ``public/`` routing :func:`public_dir` describes). Writes here are non-strict, and the fallback URL is ``versioned``: re-running a figure cell after an edit is a fresh blob under the same name, which should replace it *and* be what the browser then shows.

    Externalizing in both keeps a heavy report renderable interactively. Inlined as ``data:`` URIs, a page of figures is tens of MB of base64 in the cell outputs, which marimo refuses to display past its output size limit. *link* names the export's asset subdir; the interactive prefix is fixed by what marimo serves.

    *refs* is the bundle's provenance sidecar content (ref name → the producer stamped at ``set_ref`` time). Each producing experiment gets one line — name, code state, run date — with the resolved ref names beneath it, inside a ``<details>`` chip pinned bottom-left (above Marimo's app layer, scrolling to rest at the foot of the report). A report whose refs carry no producer (or that read no refs at all) is left untouched. Content is derived only from the store's refs, so re-exporting unchanged data injects the same footer.
