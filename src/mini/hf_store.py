"""
Hugging Face bucket backend for the artifact :class:`~mini.store.Store`.

A bucket (``hf://buckets/<namespace>/<name>``) is a Xet-backed, mutable repo with
no git history — so concurrent writers don't conflict and immutability is ours to
enforce by writing once per content hash. We lay the same ``cas/<sha256>`` /
``refs/`` / ``published/`` structure over it as :class:`~mini.store.LocalStore`,
so an :class:`~mini.store.Artifact` handle resolves identically whichever backend
produced it.

Three properties make this the durable, shareable tier:

- **One bucket per project** → ``has(sha)`` is a cross-experiment hit, so a blob
  one experiment uploads is skipped (not re-uploaded) by another, and Xet dedups
  the chunks underneath for free.
- **Reachable everywhere** — from a Modal worker, a local report, or a browser —
  so it retires the per-experiment-Volume limitation for *artifacts* (the Volume
  becomes an optional warm cache, not the source of truth).
- **Web-serving for free** — :meth:`publish` server-side-copies a blob *by xet
  hash* (no bytes moved) to an extensioned path, and the bucket's resolve URL
  then serves it with a ``Content-Type`` inferred from that extension.

Blobs are warm-cached into a local :class:`~mini.store.LocalStore` so a re-read
(or a re-``put`` of known bytes) skips the network. The bucket stays the source
of truth; the cache is just an accelerator.

**The publish tier can live in a separate dataset repo.** ``put``/``get``/refs run
hot and concurrent (many workers), which is why the CAS is a bucket — buckets have
no git history, so parallel writers never conflict. ``publish`` and report exports
run cold and single-writer (a driver or CI), so they can afford a git-backed
Hugging Face *dataset repo*, which buys two things a bucket can't: a **public**
face over a **private** CAS (buckets have no per-prefix ACL, so this is a genuine
two-store split), and **versioned names** — a citation pins to a commit sha. Set
``publish_repo`` (``[tool.mini] publish-repo``) to route publish/exports there;
unset, they stay in the bucket. See ``eng/publishing.md`` and issue #38.
