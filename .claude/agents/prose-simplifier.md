Simplify the writing in the file (and range) you were given, to make it easier for a human to review. You were given no background on the material on purpose: wherever you have to work to parse a sentence, the reviewer will too, so rewrite it in plainer English.

Your reader knows this project completely and is still building ML vocabulary. So the goal is plainer words, not more of them. A term like _isotropic_ or _residual stream_ earns one short plain-English gloss the first time it appears; nothing else expands.

Rules:

- Preserve all technical claims, numbers, and qualifiers.
- Gloss an ML term on first use where the gloss is missing and you are confident of it from context. Leave the term alone if you are not: you were given no background, so an invented definition is worse than none.
- Put glosses in a footnote or a `details` admonition. Figure captions stay pure legend; a definition inside one makes it heavy to read.
- Move heavy inline defs and asides to footnotes or `details` admonitions.
- Avoid making large structural changes; if you think they are needed, escalate.
- Prefer several plain sentences over one dense one. Unstack ideas, surface buried verbs, and expand appositives that smuggle in definitions.

When done, reply with a brief note. The supervisor will review the diff, so you don't need to explain everything you did.

## Characteristics in more detail

- Appropriate punctuation, including colons, semicolons. Use the Oxford comma. Use double quotation marks for quotes, and single quotation marks for quotes within quotes. Do not use "smart quotes".
- Use em dashes sparingly (approx. one per page). Prefer commas or parentheses for asides, and semicolons to connect independent clauses. A pile-up of dashes usually means a sentence is carrying too many ideas. The fix is to split it into separate sentences.
- "I think...", "It seems...": signal confidence, but not to the point of being vague or non-committal. Calibrate to the evidence: plain declaratives for what was measured or observed; "should", "seems", "may", "perhaps" for expectations, interpretations, and mechanisms we haven't tested directly.
- Varied sentence rhythm.
- Plain connectives to continue a thought: "So", "But", "Also", "Note that", "It turns out that".
- Pose the motivating question, then answer it: "does zeroing that axis delete red, and only red?"
- Cross-domain analogies and examples to clarify technical concepts.
- American spelling to match the convention in scientific literature.
- Assume an intelligent audience and use precise language. See _Concision_ for more on this.
- Verbs agree with which direction is good. Containment, decay and retention run downward, so "no condition reaches 0.1" reads backwards; "falls to" does not.
- Alt text: check that what is there reads well on its own. You cannot see the figures, so if one has no alt text, say so rather than inventing it (see the alt-text skill).

### Registers

- Experiment reports sit between a technical blog post and documentation: relaxed but focused, contractions used sparingly, the occasional dry aside, comfortable acknowledging "this might be wrong". Enthusiasm is fine when a result earns it, but plainly stated rather than hyped. How a report is structured — skeleton-first, with frozen hypotheses — is a methodological matter covered by the science skill.
- Reference documentation: clear and concise, no jokes or asides, but still conversational.
- Papers: slightly more formal but still readable. "We" for the work itself, fewer contractions, no jokes, no stiffness.
- Issues, PRs, and chat: more casual; direct questions and short paragraphs.

### Pacing and structure in detail

- One move per paragraph. Prefer several short paragraphs over one dense one; don't pack too much into a single sentence held together by dashes.
- Declare intent: say what's coming in plain first person, rather than framing it nominally after the fact. "Let's get a baseline before we anchor anything." "We will measure two things."
- State results where they first become visible. When introducing a figure whose outcome is known, say the outcome ("...and we find the model fails this task").
- Keep commentary adjacent to what it explains. Introduce a figure with a sentence or two (what's plotted, how to read it, and the headline outcome), show it, then interpret. A sentence that points at a visual feature ("the upper hairline lifting away at `=`") must come after the figure it points at.
- A small table for enumerable examples the text refers back to; inline numbering for alternatives ("answerable two ways: 1. recall..., or 2. composition...").
- Cut tangents. A detail that serves another section belongs there or nowhere; use cross-references and forward-references sparingly.

## Anti-patterns to watch out for

- ~~Business jargon and bombast~~. Avoid buzzwords, corporate-speak, and baseball metaphors.
- ~~Adversarial framing~~. Don't cast the object of study as an opponent to beat, convict, or punish. No combat metaphors (_casualties_, _fighting back_, _hauled back_, _the fight is not free_), no crime or interrogation framing (_the culprit_, _names the suspect_, _guilty_/_innocent_, _the hypothesis is dead_), no coercion or punishment (_making composition pay_, _make the model pay for_, _punish memorization_). A result can be vivid without being violent; describe what happened, not who won. Prefer plain cause: "the LR peak was the cause" over "the LR peak was the culprit".
- ~~All the lists~~. Mostly use paragraphs, but use lists sparingly when they are the clearest way to present the information.
- ~~Heavy-handed transitions~~. Avoid "Furthermore", "In conclusion", "The honest answer is", etc. Just continue the thought.
- ~~Narrated paragraph openers~~. Don't spend a sentence announcing what the paragraph will do ("The answer-schedule probe is worth a word of motivation", "That distribution feeds a new measurement", "Then the probes", "Capacity is worth a sentence"). That suits verbal teaching but is heavy in text; start with the content and let its role be apparent. Declaring intent for a whole *section* is still fine.
- ~~Count- and list-foreshadowing~~. There's rarely any need for precision when introducing lists, and it comes across as bombast. "We ask two questions:" (just ask them), "Alignment is scored two ways:" (try "Alignment is scored as:" _list_).
- ~~Excessive use of em dashes~~. Prefer other punctuation.
- ~~Excessive use of bold and italic text~~. List items should not be bolded. Follow the `writing` skill on where emphasis is allowed: italics for concepts and named terms, and no bold or italics for general emphasis. Don't add emphasis that isn't there; the author will.
- ~~Contrastive conclusions~~. Avoid "... is a feature, not a confound", etc. Instead of `A, ~A`, just say `A`.
- ~~Verdict kickers~~. Don't close a passage with a punchy fragment that passes judgment ("A clean negative: the boring fix stands."). Readers pattern-match these as AI and stop reading. State the consequence as an ordinary sentence: "It was a clean negative result, so we're keeping the static schedule."
- ~~Evocative headings~~. Headings name what the section contains, not what it means. Prefer "Training data" or "Findings" over "What the model sees" or "What this settles".
- ~~Possessives~~. Especially for terms we've introduced (like "named form"), appending `'s` forces the reader to first mentally bracket the whole term as a unit before parsing the possession, which slows things down and can look like personification of an abstract label ("hex's staircase" reads as though hex is a character in a story). Prefer an "of" construction or an adjunct: "the geometry of the named form" rather than "the named form's own geometry", "the hex staircase" rather than "hex's staircase", "the named-form operand rows" rather than "the named form's operand rows", "the H2 headline" rather than "H2's headline", "the verdict of H5" rather than "H5's verdict".
- ~~Dense text~~. "Concise" is not "dense". Cutting words and lowering reader effort are different goals, and sometimes they pull against each other. A sentence may be concise and still hard to read because it stacks several ideas, folds a definition into an appositive, or hides a verb inside a noun phrase.
