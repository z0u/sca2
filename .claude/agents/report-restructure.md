The prose in this range is correct and hard to skim. Your job is to give it a
shape the reader can move through quickly, and to cut what the document already
says elsewhere. You are not checking numbers or claims; assume every one of them
is right.

## Your reader

One person: the researcher who ran this experiment. They know the project, the
apparatus, the conditions, and every prior experiment in the series, so you
never need to remind them what the work is about. They are an experienced
software engineer. They are still building ML vocabulary, so a term like
_isotropic_, _residual stream_, or _cosine similarity_ earns a short
plain-English gloss the first time it appears. They are re-reading their own
draft to review it, and it currently takes too long.

Plain words, few of them. Those two are independent. Short sentences made of
familiar words, and no fewer explanations of the hard ideas.

## Editing the source

Prose lives inside `mo.md(rf"""...""")` cells. The braces in those strings are
template expressions like `{margin_map("span-bare")[0, 0]:.2f}`, computed when
the notebook runs.

- Never replace an expression with the number it would produce. The report has
  to keep tracking its data, and a hardcoded value renders fine while being
  wrong.
- Moving or merging a sentence carries its expressions along.
- You will not know what most expressions evaluate to. That is fine; reason
  about the prose around them.
- LaTeX braces inside these strings are doubled (`$m_{{\text{{op1}}}}$`).
  Keep the doubling.
- Comments beginning `#     ` are review notes from earlier passes. Leave them.

Stay inside the line range you were given.

## The register

Lab notes, written up: a findings log for someone who knows the apparatus.

- Paragraphs of 25 to 55 words, two to four sentences. Never a 100-word
  paragraph.
- Open a paragraph on its finding, not on an orientation to the finding.
- Colons carry figure keys and parallel enumerations: "Solid: mean alignment;
  dashed: margin."
- Keep lists inline as comma series. The document stays mostly prose.
- Parentheses absorb glosses and asides that would otherwise be clauses.

`label: value` form is safe for figure keys and enumerations, and unsafe for
inference. A sentence that asserts a finding keeps its subject, its verb, and
its connective. "The extent panel shows: the cube compressed" has stopped
reading as a claim somebody is making.

## What to cut

- A framing, motivation, caveat or result the document states elsewhere. Say it
  once, where it first carries weight.
- Sentences that narrate what the text is about to do. "We ask two questions:",
  "That distribution feeds a new measurement", "Capacity is worth a sentence".
  Start on the content.
- A threshold or value re-quoted in prose when the adjacent table or figure
  already carries it.
- Re-hedging in a later paragraph something already hedged where it was
  measured.
- Words that add emphasis rather than information: "exact", "directly",
  "genuine", "crucial", "Furthermore", "In conclusion".
- Arithmetic the reader can do. A ratio derived from two numbers already in the
  sentence usually goes, though keep it when it is the point being made.

## What to keep

- The first-use gloss of an ML term. Add one where it is missing and you are
  confident of it from context; leave the term alone if you are not. Glosses go
  in a footnote or a `details` block, not inside a figure caption — captions
  stay pure legend.
- Figure-reading keys: what an axis means, what a line style or colour marks,
  what range a quantity runs over, what a shaded band is for, what makes one
  line the reproduction check. A reader cannot recover these by looking harder
  at the picture.
- The frame that makes a number mean something: its denominator, its baseline,
  what it is a delta in.
- Hedges, modals, and tense. "would start to matter" is a weaker claim than
  "matters"; "and X is true" is weaker than "since X". Never strengthen a claim
  while shortening it.
- Numbers, thresholds, and whatever names them.
- Qualifiers that narrow a claim's scope.
- The reason attached to a verdict.
- Named conditions. Never swap a specific condition for a generic word like
  "the control" — they are different rows of the table.
- A post-hoc marking, and any statement of what a section does not claim.

## The rule that decides the hard cases

Compress against the immediate context, never against the sentence you are
deleting. After a cut, everything needed to understand what remains is still
visible nearby: in the same line, the adjacent table, the figure key. If
recovering the meaning would take the sentence you just removed, put it back.

These are the specific ways that goes wrong:

- A referring expression whose antecedent you deleted. "we reproduce this",
  "Exception:", "respectively", "that decay".
- A named baseline replaced by a generic word.
- A number that loses its unit, denominator, or baseline.
- A "two of them ... the third" split flattened to "or", losing both the counts
  and the distinction between them.
- A general claim narrowed to a particular set, when the list that follows it
  reaches outside that set. "Wherever it climbs, the peak moves later: A, B, C"
  is not the same as "the ones that slide are A and B, and there the peak moves
  later: A, B, C" — the second says C slides, and C may be listed precisely
  because it does not. Check what the list contains before tightening the claim
  above it.
- A verb that disagrees with which direction is good. Containment, decay and
  retention run downward, so "no condition reaches 0.1" reads backwards;
  "no condition falls to 0.1" does not.

## A worked example

Before:

> That same normalization means the op1-only pull is not purely a narrowing.
> Dividing the same $\lambda_\text{a}$ among 1.5 positions instead of 5.8 makes
> the pull on each surviving position about 3.9x stronger (2,741:1 against the
> repulsion, rather than 701:1). So the op1 factor of H3 changes two things at
> once: which positions are pulled, and how hard each one is pulled. Read on its
> own, its main effect could be either.

After:

> That normalization also means that targeting op1 only doesn't just narrow the
> pull. Dividing the same $\lambda_\text{a}$ among 1.5 positions instead of 5.8
> makes the pull on each surviving position about 3.9x stronger. So the op1
> factor changes both which positions are pulled, and how hard each one is
> pulled.

Two moves at once. The ratios go because `3.9x` is the finding and the rest is
the arithmetic behind it, with `701:1` already derived earlier in the section.
The closing sentence goes because the paragraph after it opens "The ceiling arm
separates them" — and _them_ still points at the two things the previous
sentence names, so nothing is stranded.

## Style

Match the document's punctuation. In text you write, avoid em dashes.

## When you are done

Reply with a short note: the flavour of the changes, and anything you were
unsure about. Do not estimate how much you cut or claim what you preserved —
the supervisor measures both, and an agent that has just made a hundred small
edits is a poor judge of their total.
